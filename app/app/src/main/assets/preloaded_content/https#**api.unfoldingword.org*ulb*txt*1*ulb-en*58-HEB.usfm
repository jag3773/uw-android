After he had made cleansing for the sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high.\s5\v 4 He has become as superior to the angels, as the name that he has inherited is more excellent than them.\v 5 For to which of the angels did he ever say,\q "You are my Son;\q Today I have become your father"?\p And again,\q "I will be to him a Father,\q And he will be to me a Son?"\s5\p\v 6 And again, when he brought the firstborn into the world he said, "And all the angels of God must worship him."\v 7 About the angels he says,\q "He who makes his angels spirits,\q And his servants flames of fire."\s5\p\v 8 But about the Son he says,\q "Your throne, O God, is for ever and ever,\q And the scepter of justice is the scepter of your kingdom.\q\v 9 You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness;\q Therefore God, your God, has anointed you\q With the oil of joy above your companions."\s5\p\v 10 \q "You, Lord, in the beginning laid the foundation of the earth,\q And the heavens are the works of your hands.\q\v 11 They will perish; but you will continue.\q And they will all wear out like a garment.\q\v 12 And you will roll them up like a cloak;\q and they will be changed like a garment.\q But you are the same,\q And your years will not cease."\s5\p\v 13 But to which of the angels has God said at any time,\q "Sit at my right hand,\q until I make your enemies a stool for your feet?"\p\v 14 Are not all angels spirits sent out to serve and care for those who are about to inherit salvation?\s5\c 2\p\v 1 Therefore we must give far more  attention to what we have heard, unless we abandon it.\v 2 For certainly the message that was spoken through the angels is valid, and every transgression and disobedience received a just punishment.\s5\v 3 How then can we escape if we neglect so great a salvation? This salvation was first announced by the Lord and was confirmed to us by those who heard it.\v 4 God also testified by signs and wonders and by various miracles, and by gifts of the Holy Spirit which he distributed according to his own will.\s5\p\v 5 God did not put the world to come under the angels.\v 6 Instead, someone has somewhere testifed and said,\q "What is man, that you are mindful of him?\q Or the son of man, that you care for him?\q\s5\v 7 You made man a little lower than the angels;\q You crowned him with glory and honor.\q\v 8 You put everything in subjection under his feet."\p For God subjected everything to mankind. He did not leave anything that was not subject to him. But now we do not yet see everything subjected to him.\s5\v 9 But we do see him who has been made a little lower than the angelsâJesus, who because of his suffering and death has been crowned with glory and honor.  So now by the grace of God Jesus has tasted death for every man.\v 10 It was proper that God, because everything is for him and through him, should bring many sons to glory, and should make the author of their salvation complete through his sufferings.\s5\v 11 For both he who sanctifies and those who are sanctified are all from one source, God. For this reason the one who sanctifies is not ashamed to call them brothers;\v 12 he says,\q "I will proclaim your name to my brothers;\q from inside the assembly I will sing about you."\s5\p\v 13 And again, \q "I will trust in him." And again, "See, here am I and the children whom God has given me."\v 14 Therefore, since the children of God all share flesh and blood, Jesus also shared the same things, so that through death he might make ineffective him who had the power of death, that is to say, the devil.\v 15 This was so he might free all those who through fear of death lived all their lives in the bondage of death. \s5\v 16 For surely it is not the angels that he is helping; instead, he is helping Abraham's descendants.\v 17 Therefore it was necessary for him to become like his brothers in all ways so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest over the things for God, and to achieve forgiveness for the sins of the people.\v 18 Because Jesus himself has suffered, being tempted, he is able to help those who  are being tempted.\s5\c 3\p\v 1 Therefore, holy brothers, partners of a heavenly calling, consider Jesus, the Apostle and High Priest of our confession.\v 2 He was faithful to God, who appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all God's house.\v 3 For Jesus has been considered worthy of greater glory than Moses, because he who builds the house has more honor than the house itself.\v 4 For every house is built by someone, but he who built everything is God.\s5\v 5 And Moses indeed was faithful as a servant in all God's house, giving a testimony of those things that were to be spoken of in the future.\v 6 But Christ is the Son over God's house. We are his house if we hold fast our confidence and glory in our hope to the end.\s5\v 7 Therefore, it is just as the Holy Spirit says:\q "Today if you hear his voice,\q\v 8 Do not harden your hearts\q as the Israelites did in the rebellion,\q in the time of the trial in the wilderness.\s5\q\v 9 This was where your fathers rebelled by testing me,\q And where they saw my deeds for forty years.\q\v 10 Therefore I was displeased with that generation,\q And said, 'They are always going astray in their hearts,\q and they did not know my ways.\q\v 11 It is as I swore in my anger:\q They will not enter into my rest.'"\s5\p\v 12 Listen carefully, brothers, so that there may not be in any one of you an evil heart of unbelief, one that will turn away from the living God.\v 13 But encourage one another daily, so long as it is called today, so that no one among you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.\s5\v 14 For we have become partners of Christ if we firmly hold to our confidence in him from the beginning to the end,\v 15 about which it is said,\q "Today if you will listen to his voice,\q  Do not harden your hearts, as they did in the rebellion."\s5\p\v 16 Who was it who heard God and rebelled? Was it not all those whom Moses had led out of Egypt?\v 17 And with whom was God angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose dead bodies lay in the desert?\v 18 And to whom did God swear that they should not enter into his rest, if he was not speaking about those who were disobeying him?\v 19 And we see that they were not able to enter it because of unbelief.\s5\c 4\p\v 1 Therefore, we must be very careful unless the continuing promise to enter into God's rest might seem to have failed to reach some of you,\v 2 For we have had the good news about God's rest proclaimed to us just as the Israelites had, but hearing that word did not benefit those who heard it without receiving it by faith.\s5\v 3 For it is we who have believed who will enter into that rest, just as it says:\q "As I swore in my wrath,\q They will not enter into my rest."\p He said this, even though his created works had been finished from the beginning of the world.\v 4 For he has said somewhere concerning the seventh day, \q "God rested on the seventh day from all his works."\v 5 And again he has said,\q "They will not enter into my rest."\s5\p\v 6 Therefore, since God's rest is still reserved for some to enter, and since many Israelites who heard the good news about his rest did not enter because of disobedience, \v 7 God has again established a certain day, called,"Today." David said after a long time as it had already been said, \q "Today if you will listen to his voice,\q do not harden your hearts." \s5\p\v 8 For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken about another day.\v 9 Therefore there is a sabbath rest reserved for the people of God.\v 10 For he who enters into God's rest has himself also rested from his works, as God did from his.\v 11 Therefore let us be eager to enter into that rest, so that no one will fall through their example of disobedience.\s5\v 12 For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword. nd it pierces even to the dividing of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and is able to discern the thoughts and intents of the heart.\v 13 No created thing is hidden from God's sight. Instead, everything is naked and laid open before his eyes, to whom we must give account.\s5\p\v 14 Having then a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly our confession.\v 15 For we do not have a high priest who cannot feel sympahty for our weaknesses, but one who has in all ways been tempted as we are, except without sin.\v 16 Let us therefore come near with confidence to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.\s5\c 5\p\v 1 For every high priest, chosen from among men, is appointed to act on behalf of people in things pertaining to God, so that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins.\v 2 He can deal gently with the ignorant and the wayward since he himself also is burdened with weakness.\v 3  Because of this, he also is obligated to present sacrifices for his sins just as he does for the people's sins.\s5\v 4 And no man takes this honor for himself, but instead he must be called by God, just as Aaron was.\v 5 In this way, Christ also did not raise himself up to become high priest, but God spoke to him:\q "You are my Son;\q Today I have become your Father."\s5\p\v 6 Just as he also says  in another place,\q "You are a priest forever\q After the order of Melchizedek."\s5\p\v 7 During the time of his flesh, he offered up prayers and requests, crying out with tears to God, the one able to save him from death. And because of his reverence for God, he was heard. \v 8 Even though he was a Son, he learned obedience from the things he suffered.\s5\v 9 And being perfected, he became for everyone who obeys him the cause of eternal salvation,\v 10 being designated by God as high priest by after the order of Melchizedek.\p\v 11 Concerning Jesus, we have much to say, but it is hard to explain since you are dull of hearing.\s5\v 12 For though by this time you ought to be teachers, it is still necessary that someone teach you the basic principles of God's words. You are in need of milk, not solid food.\v 13 For anyone who can only drink milk is inexperienced in the message of righteousness, for he is still a baby.\v 14 But solid food is for full-grown adults, the ones who because of their experience in distinguishing right from wrong have been trained to discern both good and evil. \s5\c 6\p\v 1 Therefore leaving what we first learned about the message of Christ, we must press on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God,\v 2 or of teaching about baptisms, laying on of hands, resurrection of the dead, and  eternal judgment.\v 3 And this we will we do, if God permits.\s5\v 4 For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, who tasted the heavenly gift, who were sharers of the Holy Spirit,\v 5 and who tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come,\v 6 and who then fell awayâit is impossible to restore them again to repentance; because they crucified in themselves the very Son of God again, and making him an object of public ridicule.\s5\v 7 For the land that has received the rain which often falls upon it, and that produces a crop useful for those who worked the land, receives a blessing from God.\v 8 But if it bears thorns and thistles, it is worthless and is in danger of being cursed; its end comes in burning.\s5\p\v 9 Even though we speak like this, dear friends, we are convinced of better things concerning you and things that are about salvation.\v 10 For God is not so unjust as to forget your work and the love that you showed for his name, in that you served  the saints and still do serve them.\s5\v 11 And we greatly desire that each of you may show the same diligence to the very end with full assurance of confidence.\v 12 And we desire that you do not become  sluggish, but that you be imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.\s5\p\v 13 For when God made his promise to Abraham, since he could not swear by anyone greater, he swore by himself\v 14 and said, "I will certainly bless you, and I will greatly multiply your descendants."\v 15 And thus, after waiting patiently, Abraham obtained what was  promised.\s5\v 16 For people swear by someone greater than themselves, and in every dispute of theirs the oath is final for confirmation.\v 17 When God determined to show more clearly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeable quality of his purpose, he secured it with an oath.\v 18 He did this so that by two unchangeable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled for refuge may have a strong encouragement to hold fast to the confidence that is set before us.\s5\v 19 We have this confidence as a secure and reliable anchor of the soul, confidence that enters into the inner place behind the curtain.\v 20 Jesus entered into that place as a forerunner for us, having become a high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.ng\s5\c 7\p\v 1 For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him,\v 2 and to whom Abraham gave a tenth of everythingâhas a name that means "king of righteousness," and also "king of Salem," that is, "king of peace." \v 3 He was without father, without mother, without ancestors, without a beginning of days nor end of life, but like the Son of God, he remains a priest forever.\s5\p\v 4 Now consider how great this man was, to whom our father Abraham gave a tenth out of the best goods that he had taken.\v 5 And indeed, the descendants of Levi who receive the priestâs office have a command to collect  tithes according to the law from the people, that is, from their brothers, even though they, too, come from Abraham's loins.\v 6 But Melchizedek, who is not a descendant from Levi, received tithes from  Abraham, and blessed him, the one having the promises.\s5\v 7 There is no denying that the lesser person is blessed by the greater person.\v 8 And in this case men, who will die one day, receive tithes, but in the other case the one who received tithes is described as living on.\v 9 And, in a manner of speaking, Levi, who received tithes, also paid tithes through Abraham, \v 10 because Levi was in the genitals of his ancestor Abraham when Melchizedek met Abraham.\s5\p\v 11 Now if perfection were possible through the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people have received the Law), what further need was there that another priest should arise after the order of Melchizedek, and not be named after the order of Aaron?\v 12 For when the priesthood is changed, a change of the law is necessarily made also.\s5\v 13 For the one about whom these things are said belongs to another tribe, from which no man has ever served at the altar.\v 14 Therefore, it is evident that our Lord has descended from Judah, a tribe that Moses never mentioned concerning priests.\s5\v 15 And what we say is clearer yet if another priest arises in the likeness of Melchizedek, \v 16 who has not become a priest on the basis of the law of human descent, but instead according to the power of an indestructible life.\v 17 For Scripture witnesses about him:\q "You are a priest forever\q After the order of Melchizedek."\s5\p\v 18 For the former commandment has been set aside because it is weak and useless.\v 19 For the law made nothing perfect, and yet it introduced a better hope through which we draw near to God.\s5\v 20 And this better hope was not without taking an oath, for priests did not take an oath.\v 21 But God took an oath when he said about Jesus,\q "The Lord swore and will not change his mind,\q You are a priest forever."\s5\p\v 22 By this also Jesus has become the guarantee of a better covenant.\v 23 And indeed, death prevents priests from serving forever. This is why there are many priests, one after another.\v 24 But because Jesus lives forever, his priesthood is unchangeable.\s5\v 25 Therefore he is also able to save to the uttermost those who draw near to God through him, because he always lives to intercede for them.\v 26 For such a high priest is right for us. He is sinless, blameless, pure, separated from sinners, and has become higher than the heavens.\s5\v 27 He does not need, unlike the high priests, to daily offer up sacrifices, first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people.  He did this once for all, when he offered up himself.\v 28 For the law appoints men with weakness as high priests, but the word of the oath, which came after the law, appointed a Son, who is perfect forever.\s5\c 8\p\v 1 Now the point of what we are saying is this: we have a high priest who has sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,\v 2 a minister in the holy places and of the true tabernacle that the Lord set up, not man.\s5\v 3 For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices; therefore it is necessary that to have something to offer.\v 4 Now if Christ were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, since  there are already those who offer the gifts according to the Law.\v 5 They serve something that is a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, just as Moses was warned by God when he was about to make the tabernacle: "See", God said, "that you make everything according to the pattern that was shown to you on the mountain."\s5\v 6 But now Christ has received a superior ministry because he is also the mediator of a better covenant, which has been established upon better promises.\v 7 For if that first covenant had been faultless, then there would have not been a need to seek a second covenant.\s5\v 8 For when God found fault with the people, he said,\q " 'See, the days are coming,' says the Lord,\q 'That I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah.\q\v 9 It will not be like the covenant that I made with their fathers\q On the day that I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt.\q For they did not continue in my covenant,\q And I paid no more attention to them,' says the Lord.\s5\q\v 10 'For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel\q After those days,' says the Lord.\q 'I will put my laws into their minds,\q And I will also write them on their hearts, \q And I will be their God,\q And they will be my people.\s5\q\v 11 They will not teach each one his neighbor\q And each one his brother, saying, "Know the Lord,"\q For all will know me,\q From the least to the greatest of them.\q\v 12 For I will show mercy on their acts of unrighteousness,\q And I will remember their sins no more.' "\s5\p\v 13 In saying "new," he has made the first covenant old. And that which he has declared to be old is ready to disappear.\s5\c 9\p\v 1 Now even the first covenant had a place for worship here on earth and regulations for worship. \v 2 For in the tabernacle there was a room prepared, the outer room, which is called the holy place, in which were the lampstand, the table, and the bread of the presence.\s5\v 3 And behind that room was another room that was called the most holy place.\v 4 It had a golden altar of incense, and it had the ark of the covenant, which was completely overlaid with gold. Inside it was a golden jar holding the manna, Aaronâs rod that budded, and the tablets of the covenant.\v 5 Above the ark of the covenant figures of glorious cherubim hovered over the atonement lid, which we cannot now describe in detail.\s5\v 6 After these things have been prepared, the priests regularly enter the outer room of the tabernacle to perform their services.\v 7 But the high priest enters the second room alone once each year, but not without offering a blood sacrifice for himself and for the people because they lack knowledge.\s5\v 8 The Holy Spirit is demonstrating that the way into the most holy place has not yet been revealed as long as the outer room is still standing.\v 9 This is a figure for the present time. Both the gifts and sacrifices  that are offered are not able to perfect the conscience of the worshiper. \v 10 They are only food and drink  and various washingsâregulations of the flesh provided until the time that the new order would be imposed.\s5\p\v 11 Christ came as a high priest of the good things that have come, through the greater and more perfect Sacred Tent that is not made by human hands, one not of this created world.\v 12 Not by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood, Christ entered into the very holy place one time for everyone and secured our redemption forever.\s5\v 13 For if the blood of goats and bulls and sprinkling the ashes of a heifer on those who are ritually unclean purifies and makes the body clean,\v 14 how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, cleanse our conscience from dead works to serve the living God?\v 15 For this reason Christ is the mediator of a new covenant because a death has taken place to free those under the first covenant from the penalty of their sins, so that those called by God might receive the promise of their eternal inheritance.\s5\v 16 For where there is a will, it is necessary to prove the death of the person who made it.\v 17 For a will is only in force where there has been death, because it has no force while he who made it lives.\s5\v 18 Therefore even the first covenant was not established without blood.\v 19 For when Moses had told every command in the Law to all the people, he took the blood of the calves and the goats, with water and red wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the scroll itself and all the people;\v 20 he said, "This is the blood of the covenant from which God has given commandments to you."\s5\v 21 In the same manner he sprinkled the blood on the  tabernacle  and all the containers used in the priestly ministry.\v 22 And according to the law, almost everything is cleansed with blood, and apart from the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.\s5\p\v 23 Therefore, it was necessary that the copies of the things in heaven should be cleansed with these animal sacrifices, but the heavenly things themselves must be cleansed with much better sacrifices than these.\v 24 For Christ did not enter into the most holy place made with hands, which is a copy of the true one, but instead  he entered heaven itself, where he now appears in the presence of God for us.\s5\v 25 Not that he should offer himself often, as the high priest did who enters into the very holy place year by year with another's blood. \v 26 Because then it would have been necessary for him to have suffered many times since the beginning of the world. But now once at the end of the ages has he been revealed to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.\s5\v 27 And just as every person is destined to die once, and after that comes judgment,\v 28 so also Christ, who was offered once to take away the sins of many, will appear a second time, without regard to sin, but for the salvation of those who wait patiently for him.   \s5\c 10\p\v 1 For the Law is only a shadow of the good things to come, not those realities themselves, and the Law  can never with the same sacrifices year after year, which the priests continually offer, make perfect those who draw near to God.\v 2 Or else would they not have ceased to be offered?âbecause the worshippers, having been once cleansed, would have had no more awareness of sins.\v 3 But in those sacrifices there is a reminder of sins committed year after year.\v 4 For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.\s5\v 5 Therefore when Christ comes into the world, he says,\q "Sacrifice and offering you did not desire,\q But you prepared a body for me.\q\v 6 You had no pleasure in whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin. \q\v 7 Then I said, "See, here I am to do your will, O God, as it is written about me in the scroll."\q \s5\p\v 8 First he stated, "You did not desire sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings for sin, nor did you take pleasure in them"âsacrifices that are offered according to the Law.\v 9 Then he said, "See, I am here to do your will." He sets aside the first practice in order that he may establish the second,\v 10 in which by God's will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.\s5\v 11 Indeed, every priest stands day by day ministering and offering the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins.\v 12 But when Christ had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, he sat down at the right side of God,\v 13 waiting until his enemies were humbled and made a stool for his feet.\v 14 For by one offering he has perfected forever those who are sanctified. \s5\v 15 And the Holy Spirit also testifies to us. For later he said,\q\v 16 " 'This is the covenant that I will make with them\q After those days,' says the Lord:\q 'I will put my laws in their hearts,\q And I will also write them on their minds.' "\s5\q\v 17 "And I will remember their sins and their acts of lawlessness no more."\p\v 18 Now where there is forgiveness for these things, there is no more offering for sin.\s5\p\v 19 Therefore, brothers, we have confidence to enter into the very holy place by the blood of Jesus,\v 20 by the way that he opened for us, a new and living way, through the curtain, that is, by means of his body.\v 21 And because we have a great priest over the house of God,\v 22 let us draw near with a true heart in the full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and having our body washed with pure water.\s5\v 23 Let us also hold tightly to the confession of our confident expectation, without wavering, because God who has promised is faithful,\v 24 and let us consider how to motivate one another to love and good deeds,\v 25 not neglecting our own assembling together, as the custom of some is, but instead encouraging one another more and more as you see the day drawing near.\s5\p\v 26 For if we deliberately go on sinning after we have received the knowledge of the truth, a sacrifice for sins no longer exists;\v 27 instead, there is a certain fearful expectation of judgment, and a fierceness of fire that will consume God's enemies.\s5\v 28 Anyone who has rejected the Law of Moses dies without mercy at the testimony of two or three witnesses.\v 29 How much more punishment do you think a person deserves who has trampled on the Son of God and has treated the blood of the covenant as something unholy, the blood by which he was sanctified, and who has insulted the Spirit of grace?\s5\v 30 For we know the one who said, "Vengeance belongs to me. I will pay back." And again, "The Lord will judge his people."\v 31 It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God!\s5\p\v 32 But remember the former days, after you were enlightened, how you endured a great agony of sufferings.\v 33 You were exposed to public ridicule both by insults and persecution, and you were participants with those who went through such suffering.\v 34 For you had compassion on those who were prisoners, and you accepted with joy the seizure of your possessions, knowing that you have for yourselves a better and eternal possession.\s5\v 35 Therefore do not throw away your confidence, which has a great reward.\v 36 For you have need of patience, so that after you have done the will of God, you may receive what he has promised.\q\v 37 "For in a very little while,\q He who is coming will come and will not delay.\s5\q\v 38 My righteous one will live by faith,\q And if he turns back, my soul will not be pleased with him."\p\v 39 But we are not some of those who turn back to destruction, but instead we are among those who have faith for the keeping of the soul.\s5\c 11\p\v 1 Now faith is the assurance of confidently expecting things, a certainty of things not seen.\v 2 For by this the ancestors were commended for their faith. \v 3 By faith we understand that the universe was created by the word of God, so that what is seen was not made out of things that were visible.\s5\v 4 By faith, Abel offered to God a more appropriate sacrifice than Cain, through which he was commended as righteous. God commended him because of his gifts, and because of that Abel still speaks even though, he is dead.\s5\v 5 By faith Enoch was taken up and did not see death. "He was not found, because God took him." For it was said of him before he was taken up that he had pleased God.\v 6 And without faith it is impossible to please God, for he who comes to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him.\s5\v 7 By faith Noah, being warned by God concerning things not yet seen, with godly reverance built a ship to save his family, by which he condemned the world and became an heir of the righteousness that comes through faith.\s5\v 8 By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed and went out to the place that he was to receive as an inheritance. He went out, not knowing where he was going.\v 9 By faith he lived in the land of promise as a foreigner dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, fellow-heirs of the same promise,\v 10 for he looked for the founding of the city whose architect and builder is God.\s5\v 11 By faith Abraham, and Sarah herself, received power to conceive even when they were too old, since they considered him faithful who had promised.\v 12 Therefore also from this one man who was near death were born countless descendants, as many as the stars in the sky and the innumerable grains of sand on the seashore.\s5\v 13 These all died in faith, not having received the promises; instead, having seen and welcomed them from far off, they admitted that they were strangers and aliens on the earth.\v 14 For those who say such things make it clear that they are seeking for a fatherland of their own.\s5\v 15 And if indeed they had been thinking of the country from which they went out, they would have had opportunity to return.\v 16 But at it is, they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed of them, to be called their God, for he has prepared a city for them. \s5\v 17 By faith Abraham, being tested, offered up Isaac. Yes, he who had gladly received the promises was offering up his only son,\v 18 about whom it was said, "From Isaac will your descendants be called."\v 19 Abraham considered that God was able to raise up Isaac, even from the dead. Figuratively speaking, he did receive him back.\s5\v 20 By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning the future things to come.\v 21 By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and he worshiped, leaning on the top of his staff.\v 22 By faith Joseph, when his end was near, spoke of the departure of the children of Israel from Egypt and commanded them to take his bones with them.\s5\v 23 By faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months by his parents because they saw he was a beautiful infant, and they were not afraid of the kingâs command.\v 24 By faith Moses, when he was grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaohâs daughter.\v 25 Instead he chose to share mistreatment with the people of God, rather than enjoy the pleasures of sin for a while.\v 26 He considered the disgrace of following Christ as greater riches than the treasures of Egypt, for he looked forward to the reward.\s5\v 27 By faith Moses left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king, for he endured by looking to him who is invisible.\v 28 By faith he observed the passover and the sprinkling of the blood, so that the destroyer of the firstborn should not touch the Isrealites.\s5\v 29 By faith they passed through the Red Sea as if over dry land. When the Egyptians tried to do it, they were swallowed up.\v 30 By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they had been circled around for seven days.\v 31 By faith Rahab the prostitute did not perish with those who were disobedient, because she had received the spies in safety.\s5\v 32 And what more can I say? For the time will fail me if I tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, both David and Samuel, and of the prophets,\v 33 who through faith conquered kingdoms, worked justice, received  promises, stopped the mouths of lions,\v 34 quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, were healed from illnesses, became mighty in war, and caused foreign armies to flee.\s5\v 35 Women received back their dead by resurrection, and others were tortured, not accepting their release so that they might experience a better resurrection.\v 36 Others had suffering of mockings and whippings, yes, even chains and imprisonment.\v 37 They were stoned. They were sawn in two.  They were slain with the sword. They went about in sheepskins and  goatskins being destitute, afflicted, and ill-treated\v 38 (of whom the world was not worthy), wandering in wildernesses , mountains, caves, and in the holes of the earth.\s5\v 39 All of these who are honored because of their faith did not receive what was promised.\v 40 God provided beforehand something better for us and for them, in order that without us they would not be perfected.\s5\c 12\p\v 1 Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a large crowd of witnesses, let us throw off everything that weighs us down and the sin that so easily entangles us, and let us run with patience the race that is placed before us.\v 2 Let us our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, ignored its shame, and has sat down at the right side of the throne of God.\v 3 For consider him who has endured such hatred from sinners against himself, so that you  do not become weary or faint-hearted.s5\v 4 You have not yet resisted and struggled against sin to the point of blood.\v 5 And you have forgotten the encouragement that instructs you as sons:\q "My son, do not lightly regard the discipline of the Lord,\q Nor lose heart when you are corrected by him;"\q\v 6 For whom the Lord loves he disciplines,\q And he punishes every son whom he receives.\s5\p\v 7 Endure trials as discipline. God deals with you as with sons, for what son is there whom his father does not discipline?  \v 8 But if you are without discipline, which we are all  to share in, then you are illegitimate children and not his.\s5\v 9 Furthermore, we had earthly fathers to discipline us, and we respected them. Should we not even more so obey the Father of spirits and live?\v 10 For they indeed disciplined us for a few years as it seemed right to them, but God disciplines us for our good so that we can share in his holiness.\v 11 All discipline in the present does not seem joyous but instead painful, yet afterward it produces the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it.\s5\v 12 Therefore lift up the hands that hang down and make strong the weak knees;\v 13 and make straight paths for your feet, so that whoever is lame will not be led astray but rather be healed.\s5\p\v 14 Pursue peace with all people, and the holiness without which no one shall see the Lord.\v 15 Carefully see that no one is excluded from God's grace, and that no root of bitterness grows up to cause trouble and pollute many.\v 16 Be careful that there not be any sexually immoral or ungodly person such as Esau, who for one meal sold his own birthright.\v 17 For you know that afterwards when he desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, because he found no opportunity for repentance with his father, even though he sought it earnestly with tears.\s5\p\v 18 For you have not come to a mountain that can be touched, a mountain of burning fire, darkness, gloom, and storm.\v 19 There was the blast of a trumpet, and words from a voice that caused those hearing it to beg that not another word be spoken to them.\v 20 For they could not bear what was commanded: "If even an animal touches the mountain, it must be stoned."\v 21 And so fearful was this sight,  Moses said, "I am so terrified that I am trembling."\s5\v 22 Instead, you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to ten thousands of angels in celebration.\v 23 You have come to the assembly of all the firstborn registered in heaven, to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of the righteous who have been perfected.\v 24 You have come to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks better than Abel's blood.\s5\v 25 See that you do not refuse him who speaks. For if they did not escape when they refused him who warned them on earth, we will certainly not escape if we turn away from him who warns from heaven.\v 26 At that time his voice shook the earth. But now he has promised and said, "Yet once more I will shake not only the earth, but also the heavens."\s5\v 27 These words, "Yet once more," indicate the removal of those things that are shaken, that is, the  things that are created, so that those things which are not shaken may remain.\v 28 Therefore, receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us be grateful and worship God acceptably with reverence and awe,\v 29 for our God is a consuming fire.\s5\c 13\p\v 1 Let brotherly love continue.\v 2 Do not forget to welcome strangers, for by this some have welcomed angels without knowing it.\s5\v 3 Remember those who are in prison, as if you were there with them and your bodies were being mistreated like theirs.\v 4 Let marriage be respected by all and let the marriage bed be kept pure, for God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterers. \s5\v 5 Let your way of life be free from the love of money. Be content with the things you have, for God himself has said, "I will never leave you, nor will I forsake you."\v 6 So that we may boldly say,\q "The Lord is my helper; I will not fear,\q What can anyone do to me?"\s5\p\v 7 Consider those who have led  you, those who spoke the word of God to you, and consider the result of their conduct; imitate their faith.\v 8 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever.\s5\v 9 Do not be led away by various and strange teachings, for it is good that the heart be built up by grace, not by rules about food that do not help those who live by them.\v 10 We have an altar at which those who serve in the tabernacle have no right to eat. \v 11 For the blood of the animals, sacrificed for sins, is brought by the high priest into the most holy place, but their bodies are burned outside the camp.\s5\v 12 Therefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people through his own blood, suffered outside the city gate.\v 13 Let us therefore go to him outside the camp, bearing his disgrace.\v 14 For we do not have here an enduring city, but instead we seek after the city that is to come.\s5\v 15 Through Jesus we should constantly offer up sacrifices of praise to God, praise that is the fruit of our lips, which acknowledge his name.\v 16 And do not forget to do good by helping one another, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.\v 17 Obey and submit to your leaders, for they keep watch over you for the sake of your souls, as those who will give account. Obey so that yout leaders may care for you with joy, and not with grief, which would not help you.\s5\p\v 18 Pray for us, for we are persuaded that we have a clear conscience, desiring to live honorably in all things.\v 19 And I encourage you all the more to do this, so that I may be be able to return to you sooner.\s5\p\v 20 Now may the God of peace, who brought back from the dead the great shepherd of the sheep, our Lord Jesus, by the blood of an eternal covenant,\v 21 equip you with every good thing to do his will, working in us that which is well-pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.\b\s5\p\v 22 But I encourage you, brothers, bear with the word of encouragement that I have briefly written to you.\v 23 Know that our brother Timothy has been set free, with whom I will see you if he comes soon. \s5\p\v 24 Greet all your leaders and all who have been set apart for God. Those from Italy greet you.\p\v 25 Grace be with you all.
