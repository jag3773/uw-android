\mt The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians


\s5
\c 1
\p
\v 1 Paul, an apostle—not an apostle from men nor through human agency, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead ones—
\v 2 and all the brothers with me, to the churches of Galatia:

\s5
\v 3 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,
\v 4 who gave himself for our sins so that he might deliver us from this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father,
\v 5 to him be the glory forever and ever. Amen.
\b

\s5
\p
\v 6 I am amazed that you are turning away so quickly from him who called you by the grace of Christ. I am amazed that you are turning to a different gospel.
\v 7 This is not to say that there is another gospel, but there are some men who cause you trouble and want to change the gospel of Christ.

\s5
\v 8 But even if we or an angel from heaven should proclaim to you a gospel other than the one we proclaimed to you, let him be cursed.
\v 9 As we have said before, so now I say again, "If someone proclaims to you a gospel other than the one you received, let him be cursed."
\v 10 For am I now seeking the approval of men or God? Am I seeking to please men? If I am still trying to please men, I am not a servant of Christ.

\s5
\p
\v 11 For I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel I proclaimed is not man's gospel.
\v 12 I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it. Instead, it was by revelation of Jesus Christ to me.

\s5
\v 13 You have heard about my former life in Judaism, how I was persecuting the church of God beyond measure and that I was trying to destroy it.
\v 14 I advanced in Judaism beyond many of those who were my own age, from out of my own people. That is how extremely zealous I was for the traditions of my fathers.

\s5
\v 15 But when God, who had set me apart from my mother's womb, and who called me through his grace,
\v 16 was pleased to reveal his Son in me, so that I would proclaim him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately consult with flesh and blood.
\v 17 I did not go up to Jerusalem to those who had become apostles before me. Instead, I went to Arabia and then returned to Damascus.

\s5
\p
\v 18 Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to get to know Cephas and I stayed with him fifteen days.
\v 19 But I saw none of the other apostles except James, the Lord's brother.
\v 20 In what I write to you, I assure you before God, that I am not lying.

\s5
\v 21 Then I went to the regions of Syria and Cilicia.
\v 22 I was still not personally known to the churches of Judea that are in Christ.
\v 23 They only heard it being said, "The man who once persecuted us is now proclaiming the faith he once tried to destroy."
\v 24 And they glorified God because of me.

\s5
\c 2
\p
\v 1 Then after fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus along with me.
\v 2 I went up because of a revelation and set before them the gospel that I proclaim among the Gentiles. I spoke privately to those who seemed to be important, in order to make sure that I was not running—or had not run—in vain.

\s5
\v 3 But not even Titus, who was with me and who was a Greek, was forced to be circumcised.
\v 4 The false brothers came in secretly to spy on the liberty we have in Christ Jesus. They desired bring us into slavery,
\v 5 but we did not yield in submission to them for a moment, so that the truth of the gospel would remain with you.

\s5
\v 6 But those who seemed to be important (whatever they were does not matter to me, God shows no partiality)—those, I say, who seemed important added nothing to me. 
\v 7 On the contrary, they saw that I had been entrusted with the gospel to those who are uncircumcised, just as Peter had been entrusted with the gospel to those who are circumcised.
\v 8 For God, who worked in Peter for the apostleship to those who are circumcised, also worked in me to the Gentiles.

\s5
\v 9 When James, Cephas, and John, who were recognized as those who built up the church, understood the grace that had been given to me, they gave the right hand of fellowship to Barnabas and me. They did this so that we should go to the Gentiles, and so that they should go to those who are circumcised.
\v 10 They requested only that we remember the poor, the very thing that I was eager to do. 

\s5
\p
\v 11 But when Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face because he was declared to be in the wrong.
\v 12 Before certain men came from James, Cephas was eating with the Gentiles. But when these men came, he stopped and kept away from the Gentiles. He was afraid of those who were demanding circumcision.

\s5
\v 13 Also the rest of the Jews joined in this hypocrisy. Even Barnabas was led astray with them by their hypocrisy. 
\v 14 But when I saw that their behavior was not following the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas in front of all of them, "If you are a Jew but are living like a Gentile and not like a Jew, how can you force the Gentiles to live like Jews?"

\s5
\v 15 We ourselves are Jews by birth and not Gentile sinners;
\v 16 yet we know that no person is justified by the works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ. We also came to faith in Christ Jesus so that we might be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law. For by the works of the law no flesh will be justified.

\s5
\v 17 But if, while we seek to be justify in Christ, we too, were found to be sinners, does Christ then promote sin? Absolutely not!
\v 18 For if I rebuild those things I once destroyed, I prove myself to be a lawbreaker.
\v 19 For through the law I died to the law, so that I might live for God.

\s5
\v 20 I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me. The life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.
\v 21 I do not set aside the grace of God, for if righteousness could be gained through the law, then Christ died for nothing!

\s5
\c 3
\p
\v 1 Foolish Galatians! Whose evil eye has harmed you? Was not Jesus Christ depicted as crucified before your eyes?
\f + \ft Some older versions add, \fqa so that you should not obey the truth? \fqb \fqa \fqb \f*
\v 2 I only want to learn this from you. Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law or by believing what you heard?
\v 3 Are you so foolish? Did you begin in the Spirit only to finish now in the flesh?

\s5
\v 4 Did you experience so many things for nothing—if indeed it was for nothing?
\v 5 Then does he who gives the Spirit to you and works powerful deeds among you do it by the works of the law or by hearing with faith?

\s5
\v 6 Abraham "believed God and it was credited to him as righteousness."
\v 7 In the same way, understand, then, that those who believe are sons of Abraham.
\v 8 The scripture foresaw that God would justify the Gentiles by faith. The gospel was proclaimed beforehand to Abraham: "In you all the nations will be blessed."
\v 9 So then, those who have faith are blessed with Abraham, who had faith.

\s5
\v 10 Those who rely on the works of the law are under a curse. For it is written, "Cursed is everyone who does not abide by all the things written in the book of the law, to do it all."
\v 11 Now it is clear that God justifies no one by the law, for "The righteous will live by faith."
\v 12 The law is not from faith, but instead, "He who does these things in the law will live by the laws."

\s5
\v 13 Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law when he became a curse for us. For it is written, "Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree."
\v 14 The purpose was that the blessing that was on Abraham might come to the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, so that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.

\s5
\p
\v 15 Brothers, I speak in human terms. Even when a human contract has been established, no one voids it or adds to it.
\v 16 Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his descendant. It does not say, "to descendants," referring to many, but instead to only one, "to your descendant," who is Christ.

\s5
\v 17 Now I say this. The law, which came 430 years later, does not void the covenant previously established by God.
\v 18 For if the inheritance had come by means of the law, it would no longer have come by means of the promise. But God freely gave it to Abraham through a promise.

\s5
\v 19 Why then was the law given? It was added because of transgressions, until the descendant of Abraham would come to those to whom he had been promised. The law was put into force through angels by the hand of a mediator.
\v 20 Now a mediator implies more than one person, yet God is only one.

\s5
\v 21 So is the law against the promises of God? Absolutely not! For if a law had been given that was able to give life, righteousness would certainly have come by that law.
\v 22 But instead, scripture imprisoned all things under sin. God did this so that his promise to save us by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.

\s5
\p
\v 23 But before faith in Christ came, we were imprisoned and confined by the law until the revelation of faith.
\v 24 So then the law became our guardian until Christ came, so that we might be justified by faith.
\v 25 Now that faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian.
\v 26 For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.

\s5
\v 27 All of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.
\v 28 There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.
\v 29 If you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's descendants, heirs according to promise.

\s5
\c 4
\p
\v 1 I am saying that as long as the heir is a child, he is no different than a slave, even though he is owner of the whole estate.
\v 2 Instead, he is under guardians and trustees until the time set by his father.

\s5
\v 3 So also we, when we were children, were held in bondage to the elemental principles of the universe.
\v 4 But when the right time came, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the law.
\v 5 He did this in order to redeem those who were under the law, so that we would receive adoption as sons.

\s5
\v 6 Because you are sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, the Spirit who calls, "Abba, Father."
\v 7 For this reason you are no longer a slave but a son. If you are a son, then you are also an heir through God.

\s5
\p
\v 8 Yet before, when you did not know God, you were slaves to the ones who are by nature not gods at all.
\v 9 But now that you do know God, or rather, now that you are known by God, why are you returning again to weak and worthless elemental principles? Do you want to be slaves all over again?

\s5
\v 10 You carefully observe special days, new moons, seasons, and years.
\v 11 I fear for you. I fear that somehow I have labored over you in vain.

\s5
\p
\v 12 I beg you, brothers, become as I am, for I also have become as you are. You did me no wrong.
\v 13 But you know that it was because of a physical illness that I proclaimed the gospel to you the first time.
\v 14 Though my physical condition put you to the test, you did not despise or reject me. Instead you received me as an angel of God, as though I were Christ Jesus himself.

\s5
\v 15 Where, therefore, is now your happiness? For I testify to you that, if possible, you would have torn out your own eyes and given them to me.
\v 16 So then, have I become your enemy because I tell you the truth?

\s5
\v 17 They passionately seek you, but for no good. They want to separate you from me so you will follow them.
\v 18 It is always good to be passionate for good reasons, and not only when I am present with you.

\s5
\v 19 My little children, I am suffering labor pains for you again until Christ is formed in you.
\v 20 I would like to be present there with you now and change my tone, because I am perplexed about you.

\s5
\p
\v 21 Tell me, you who desire to be under the law, do you not hear what the law says?
\v 22 For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave woman and one by the free woman.
\v 23 However, the one by the slave was born only by the flesh, but the one by the free woman was born by a promise.

\s5
\v 24 These things can be explained using an allegory, for these women are like two covenants. One of them is from Mount Sinai. She gives birth to children who are slaves. This is Hagar.
\v 25 Now Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia. She symbolizes the present Jerusalem, for she is in slavery with her children.

\s5
\v 26 But the Jerusalem that is above is free, that is, our mother.
\v 27 For it is written,
\q "Rejoice, you barren woman, you who do not give birth.
\q Break out and shout for joy, you who do not experience child bearing.
\q For many are the children of the barren, more than those of her who has a husband."
\m

\s5
\p
\v 28 Now you, brothers, like Isaac, are children of promise.
\v 29 At that time the one who was born according to the flesh persecuted the one who was born according to the Spirit. It is the same now.

\s5
\v 30 What does the scripture say? "Drive away the slave woman and her son. For the son of the slave woman will not inherit along with the son of the free woman."
\v 31 Therefore, brothers, we are not children of a slave woman, but instead of the free woman.

\s5
\c 5
\p
\v 1 It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. So stand firm and do not be entrapped again under a yoke of bondage.
\p
\v 2 Look, I, Paul, say to you that if you become circumcised, Christ will not benefit you in any way.

\s5
\v 3 Again, I testify to every man who is circumcised that he becomes obliged to obey the whole law.
\v 4 You are separated from Christ, all you who are justified by the law. You have fallen away from grace.

\s5
\v 5 For through the Spirit, by faith, we are waiting for the confidence of righteousness.
\v 6 In Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything, but only faith working through love.
\v 7 You were running well. Who stopped you from obeying the truth?
\v 8 The persuasion to do that is not from him who calls you.

\s5
\v 9 A little yeast makes the whole lump of dough rise.
\v 10 I have confidence in you in the Lord that you will not think in any other way. He who confuses you will bear his own condemnation, whoever he is.

\s5
\v 11 Brothers, if I still proclaim circumcision, why am I still persecuted? In that case the stumbling block of the cross would be destroyed.
\v 12 I wish that those who mislead you would castrate themselves.

\s5
\p
\v 13 For God has called you, brothers, to freedom. Only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh. Instead through love serve one another.
\v 14 For the whole law is fulfilled in one commandment; in "You must love your neighbor as yourself."
\v 15 But if you bite and devour one another, watch out that you are not destroyed by one another.

\s5
\p
\v 16 I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not fulfill the desires of the flesh.
\v 17 For the flesh has strong desires against the Spirit, and the Spirit has strong desires against the flesh. For these are opposed to each other. The result is that you do not do the things you desire to do.
\v 18 But if the Spirit is leading you, you are not under the law.

\s5
\v 19 Now the works of the flesh are visible. They are sexual immorality, impurity, lustfulness,
\v 20 idolatry, sorcery, hostility, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, rivalry, dissension, sectarian division,
\v 21 envy, drunkenness, drunken riots, and other things like these. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.

\s5
\v 22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faith,
\v 23 gentleness, and self-control. There is no law against such things.
\v 24 Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and evil desires.

\s5
\p
\v 25 If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.
\v 26 Let us not become conceited, provoke one another, or envy one another.

\s5
\c 6
\p
\v 1 Brothers, if a man is caught in some transgression, you who are spiritual should restore that person in a spirit of gentleness. Watch out for yourself, so that you may not be tempted.
\v 2 Carry one another's burdens, and so you will fulfill the law of Christ.

\s5
\v 3 For if anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he deceives himself.
\v 4 Each one should examine his own work. Then he will have something in himself alone to be proud of, without comparing himself to anyone else.
\v 5 For each one will carry his own load.

\s5
\p
\v 6 The one who is taught the word must share all good things with the teacher.
\v 7 Do not be deceived. God is not mocked. Whatever a man plants, that is what he will also harvest.
\v 8 For he who sows seed to his own sinful nature will harvest destruction, but he who sows seed to the Spirit, will harvest eternal life from the Spirit.

\s5
\v 9 We should not become weary of doing good, for at the right time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up.
\v 10 So then, when we have the opportunity, let us do good to everyone. Let us especially do good to those of the household of the faith.
\b

\s5
\p
\v 11 See what large letters I write to you in my own handwriting.
\v 12 Those who want to make a good impression in the flesh compel you to be circumcised. They do this only so that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.
\v 13 For not even those who are circumcised themselves keep the law. Instead, they want you to be circumcised so that they may be proud about your flesh.

\s5
\v 14 May it never be that I am proud except of the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ. It is through him that the world has been crucified to me and I to the world.
\v 15 For neither circumcision nor uncircumcision is anything. Instead, a new creation is important.
\v 16 To all who will live by this rule, may peace and mercy be on them, and on the Israel of God.

\s5
\p
\v 17 From now on let no one trouble me, for I carry the marks of Jesus on my body.
\p
\v 18 May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen.
