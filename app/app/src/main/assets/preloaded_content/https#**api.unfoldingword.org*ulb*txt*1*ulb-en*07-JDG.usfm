\s5
\c 1
\p
\v 1 It came about after the death of Joshua that the people of Israel asked Yahweh, saying, “Who will go up for us first against the Canaanites to fight against them?
\v 2 Yahweh said, “Judah will go up; see, I have delivered the land into his hand.”
\v 3 Judah said to Simeon his brother, “Come up with me into my allotted territory, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with you into your allotted territory.” So Simeon went with him.
 
\s5
\v 4 Judah went up, and Yahweh delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand; they struck down at Bezek ten thousand of them.
\v 5 They found Adonibezek at Bezek; they fought against him, and they struck down the Canaanites and the Perizzites.
 
\s5
\v 6 But Adonibezek fled; they pursued him and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his big toes.
\v 7 Adonibezek said, “Seventy kings, having their thumbs and their big toes cut off, gathered their food under my table; as I have done, so God has done to me.” They brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.
 
\s5
\p
\v 8 The people of Judah fought against Jerusalem and took it; they struck it with the edge of the sword and set the city on fire.
\v 9 Afterward the people of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites who lived in the hill country, in the
Negev, and in the lowlands.
\v 10 Judah went against the Canaanites who lived in Hebron (the name of Hebron was previously Kiriatharba); they struck down Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.
 
\s5
\p
\v 11 From there Judah went against the inhabitants of Debir (the name of Debir was previously Kiriathsepher).
\v 12 Caleb said, “Whoever attacks Kiriathsepher and takes it, to him I will give Achsah, my daughter, as his wife.
\v 13 Othniel, the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother, captured it, so Caleb gave him Achsah, his daughter, as his wife.
 
\s5
\v 14 It came about that Achsah came to Caleb and spoke very pleasantly with him. Then she asked him for a field. She got down off her donkey, and Caleb said to her, “What do you want?”
\v 15 She said to him, “Give me a gift; because you have given me land in the Negev, give me also springs of
water.” So Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.
 
\s5
\p
\v 16 The people descended from Kenite, Moses’ brother-in-law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the people of Judah to Arad, in the wilderness of Judah, which is in the Negev; they went and lived with the people of Judah.
\v 17 Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they struck down the Canaanites who inhabited Zephath; they completely destroyed it. The name of the city then became Hormah.
 
\s5
\v 18 Judah also took Gaza with its surrounding lands, Ashkelon with its surrounding lands, and Ekron with its surrounding lands.
\v 19 Yahweh was with Judah; Judah drove out the inhabitants of
the hill country, but he could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had iron chariots.
 
\s5
\v 20 They gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses had commanded, and Caleb drove out from there the three sons of Anak.
\v 21 The people of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites who inhabited Jerusalem; instead, the Jebusites have lived with the people of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.
 
\s5
\p
\v 22 The house of Joseph also went up against Bethel, and Yahweh was with them.
\v 23 The house of Joseph sent men to scout Bethel (the name of the city was previously Luz).
\v 24 The scouts saw a man coming out of the city, and they said to him, “Show us, we beg you, a way into
the city, and we will keep our word and treat you well.”
 
\s5
\v 25 He showed them a way into the city; they struck the city with the edge of the sword, but they let the man go and all his family.
\v 26 The man then went into the land of the Hittites and built a city; he called its name Luz, which is its name
to this day.
 
\s5
\p
\v 27 Manasseh did not drive out the inhabitants of Bethshean and its towns, nor
of Taanach and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and its towns, nor
the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns. Instead, the Canaanites were able to continue living in those places.
\v 28 It came about, when Israel was strong, that they would put the Canaanites to hard labor, but they never completely drove them out.
 
\s5
\p
\v 29 Ephraim did not drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer; instead, the Canaanites lived in Gezer among them.
 
\s5
\p
\v 30 Zebulun did not drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; instead, the Canaanites lived among them and came under hard labor.
 
\s5
\p
\v 31 Asher did not drive out the inhabitants of Acco, nor the inhabitants of Sidon, nor those of Ahlab, Achzib, Helbah,
Aphik, or Rehob;
\v 32 instead, the people of Asher lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land, for they did not drive them out.
 
\s5
\p
\v 33 Naphtali did not drive out the inhabitants of Bethshemesh, nor the inhabitants of Bethanath; instead, the people of Naphtali lived among the
Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land. However, the inhabitants of Bethshemesh and Bethanath came under hard labor.
 
\s5
\p
\v 34 The Amorites forced the people of Dan into the hill country, for they did not allow them to come down to the
coastal region.
\v 35 Instead, the Amorites lived at Mount Heres, in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim; still, when the hand of the house of Joseph dominated them, they would come under hard labor.
\v 36 Now the border with the Amorites was from the Ascent of Akrabbim at Seal and went north.





\s5
\c 2
\p
\v 1 The angel of Yahweh came up from Gilgal to Bochim. He said, “I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought
you to the land which I swore to your fathers. I said, 'I will never break my covenant with you.
\v 2 You will make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land; you will break down their altars.' But you have not
listened to my voice; why have you not?
 
\s5
\v 3 Therefore I also said, 'I will not drive the Canaanites out from before you; instead, they will be
like thorns in your sides, and their gods will be a snare to you.'”
\v 4 It came about, when the angel of Yahweh spoke these words to all the people of Israel, that the people raised their voice and wept.
\v 5 They called the name of that place Bochim, and they sacrificed there to Yahweh.
 
\s5
\p
\v 6 Now when Joshua had sent the people away, the people of Israel went every man to his inheritance to possess the land.
\v 7 The people worshiped Yahweh all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua, who had seen
all of Yahweh’s marvelous deeds that he had done for Israel.
\v 8 Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Yahweh, died, being one hundred ten years old.
 
\s5
\v 9 They buried him within the border of his inheritance in Timnathheres, in the hill country of Ephraim, on the north of Mount Gaash.
\v 10 All that generation was also gathered to their fathers; another generation came after them who did not know Yahweh firsthand, nor experienced the things that he had done for Israel.
 
\s5
\p
\v 11 The people of Israel did what was evil in the sight of Yahweh and worshiped the Baals.
\v 12 They forsook Yahweh, the God of their fathers, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt; they followed other gods, some of the gods of the peoples that were around them; they bowed down to them and in this way provoked Yahweh to anger.
\v 13 They forsook Yahweh and worshiped Baal and the Ashtars.
 
\s5
\v 14 The anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of people who raided them; he sold them into the hands of their enemies around them, so that they could not any longer withstand their
enemies.
\v 15 Wherever their enemies raided them, Yahweh's hand was against them for evil, as he had spoken, and as he had sworn to them; they were very distressed.
 
\s5
\p
\v 16 Yahweh raised up judges who saved them out of the hand of those who impoverished them.
\v 17 But they did not listen not to their judges, for they acted like prostitutes, going after other gods; they bowed down to them; they quickly turned aside out of the way in which their fathers had walked in obeying the commandments of Yahweh; this new generation did not behave like them.
 
\s5
\v 18 When Yahweh raised up judges for them, then Yahweh would be with the judges and save them from the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge’s life; for Yahweh was sorry for them as they groaned because of those who oppressed them and troubled them.
\v 19 But it would it come about, when the judge was dead, that they would turn back and act even more corruptly than their fathers, in that they would follow other gods to worship them and to bow down to them. They did not stop doing this, nor cease from their stubborn ways.
 
\s5
\v 20 The anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel; he said, “Because this nation has transgressed my covenant that I had set in place for their father—because they have not listened to my voice,
\v 21 I will not, from now on, drive out from before them any of the nations that Joshua left when he died.
\v 22 I will act in this way so that I may test Israel, whether they will keep the way of Yahweh to walk in, as their fathers kept it, or not.”
\v 23 So Yahweh left those nations, without driving them out quickly; nor did he deliver them into Joshua’s hand.
 




\s5
\c 3
\p
\v 1 Now these are the nations that Yahweh left, to test Israel by means of them, all the people of Israel who had not experienced the wars in Canaan,
\v 2 so that the generations of the people of Israel might learn war, to teach them war, those who previous knew
nothing about it—
\v 3 namely, the five kings of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hivites that
lived in in the mountains of Lebanon, from Mount Baalhermon to the Lebohamath.
 
\s5
\v 4 These were left for Yahweh to test Israel by means of them, to know whether they would listen to his commandments that he had commanded their fathers through Moses.
\v 5 The people of Israel lived among the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the
Hivites, and the Jebusites;
\v 6 they took their daughters to be their wives, and they gave their own daughters to their sons and worshiped their gods.
 
\s5
\p
\v 7 The people of Israel did what was evil in the sight of Yahweh and forgot Yahweh their God; they worshiped the
 Baals and the Ashtars.
\v 8 Therefore the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Cushanrishathaim king of
Mesopotamia; the people of Israel served Cushanrishathaim eight years.
 
\s5
\v 9 When the people of Israel cried to Yahweh, Yahweh raised up a savior for the people of Israel, who rescued them,
—Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother.
\v 10 The Spirit of Yahweh came on him, and he judged Israel; he went out to war, and Yahweh delivered
Cushanrishathaim, king of Mesopotamia, into his hand; his hand defeated Cushanrishathaim.
\v 11 The land had rest forty years. Then Othniel, the son of Kenaz, died.
 
\s5
\p
\v 12 The people of Israel again did what was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and Yahweh strengthened Eglon the king
of Moab against Israel, because Israel had done what was evil in his sight.
\v 13 Eglon gathered to him the people of Ammon and Amalek; he went and attacked Israel, and they took possesson of the city of palm trees.
\v 14 The people of Israel served Eglon, the king of Moab, for eighteen years.
 
\s5
\p
\v 15 But when the people of Israel cried to Yahweh, he raised them up a savior, Ehud, the son of Gera, a
Benjamite, a left-handed man. The people of Israel sent tribute by him to Eglon, king of Moab.
 
\s5
\v 16 Ehud made himself a sword that had two edges, one cubit in length; he strapped it on under his clothing on his right thigh.
\v 17 He offered the tribute to Eglon, king of Moab. Now Eglon was a very fat man.
\v 18 When Ehud had finished offering the tribute, he sent away the people who had carried it in.
 
\s5
\v 19 He himself, however, turned back from the quarries that were by Gilgal and said, “I have a secret message for you, O king." Eglon said to everyone, “Be silent.”  All his servants standing before him went out.
\v 20 Ehud came to him; now the king was sitting by himself, alone in the cool upper room.  Ehud said, “I have a message from God for you.” Eglon rose out of his seat.
 
\s5
\v 21 Ehud reached with his left hand and took the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into the king’s body.
\v 22 The handle went in after the blade, and the fat closed on the blade, for Ehud did not draw the sword out of his body; and the blade came out behind his back.
\v 23 Then Ehud went out into the porch, shut the doors of the upper room on the king, and locked them.
 
\s5
\p
\v 24 Now after Ehud had left, the king’s servants came; they looked and, behold, the doors of the upper room were locked; they
said, “Surely he is relieving himself in the upper chamber.”
\v 25 They waited until they were embarrassed; and, behold, the king did not open the doors to  the upper room; so they took the
key and opened them; and, behold, their lord had fallen down dead on the floor.
 
\s5
\p
\v 26 While they were waiting, Ehud escaped and passed beyond the quarries, and so escaped to Seirah.
\v 27 It came about, when he had come, that he blew a trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim; the people of Israel
went down with him from the hill country, and he went ahead of them.
 
\s5
\v 28 He said to them, “Follow me, for Yahweh has delivered your enemies, the Moabites, into your hand.” They
went down after him and took the fords of the Jordan against the Moabites. They allowed not one man to cross over.
\v 29 They struck down at that time about ten thousand men of Moab, every one a strong and courageous man; not a single man escaped.
\v 30 So Moab was subdued that day by the hand of Israel, and the land had rest for eighty years.
 
\s5
\p
\v 31 After Ehud there came Shamgar, the son of Anath, who struck down six hundred men of the Philistines with an ox goad; he also saved Israel.





\s5
\c 4
\p
\v 1 After Edud died, the people of Israel again did what was evil in Yahweh's sight.
\v 2 Yahweh sold them into the hand of Jabin, king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose army was Sisera, who lived in Harosheth of the Gentiles.
\v 3 The people of Israel cried to Yahweh, for Jabin had nine hundred iron chariots; for twenty years he severely 
oppressed the people of Israel.
 
\s5
\p
\v 4 Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, was judging Israel at that time.
\v 5 She lived under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim; the people of Israel came to her with disputes to be judged.
 
\s5
\v 6 She sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam fromf Kedeshnaphtali; she said to him, “Has not Yahweh, the God of
Israel, commanded and said, ‘Go to Mount Tabor, and take with you ten thousand men of the people of
Naphtali and of the people of Zebulun’?
\v 7 I will draw to you, to the river Kishon, Sisera, the captain of Jabin’s army, with his chariots and his army;
I will deliver him into your hand.”
 
\s5
\v 8 Barak said to her, “If you go with me, then I will go; but if you do not go with me, I will not go.”
\v 9 She said, “I will certainly go with you: however, the journey that you take will not be for your honor; for
Yahweh will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman.”  Then Deborah arose and went with Barak to Kedesh.
 
\s5
\v 10 Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali together to Kedesh; ten thousand men went after him, and Deborah
went up with him.
 
\s5
\p
\v 11 Now Heber the Kenite had separated himself from the Kenites, the descendants of Hobab, Moses' brother-in-law,
and had pitched his tent as far as the oak in Zaanannim, which is by Kedesh.
 
\s5
\p
\v 12 They told Sisera that Barak, the son of Abinoam, had gone up to Mount Tabor.
\v 13 Sisera gathered together all his chariots, nine hundred iron chariots, and all the soldiers who were with him,
from Harosheth of the Gentiles to the Kishon River.
 
\s5
\v 14 Deborah said to Barak, “Rise up, for this is the day on which Yahweh has delivered Sisera into your hand; has not Yahweh gone out before you?” So Barak went down from Mount Tabor, and the ten thousand men went after him.
 
\s5
\v 15 Yahweh made it difficult for Sisera, all his chariots, and all his army, with the edge of the sword before Barak; and Sisera got down from his chariot and ran away on foot.
\v 16 But Barak pursued the chariots and the army to Harosheth of the Gentiles; all the army of Sisera fell
by the edge of the sword; not a man was left.
 
\s5
\p
\v 17 However, Sisera fled away on feet to the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, for there was peace between Jabin,
the king of Hazor, and the house of Heber the Kenite.
\v 18 Jael went out to meet Sisera and said to him, “Come in, my lord, come in to me; do not be afraid.” He came into her tent, and she covered him with a rug.
 
\s5
\v 19 He said to her, “Give me, I beg you, a little water to drink, for I am thirsty.” She opened a bottle of milk
and gave him drink, and then she covered him up.
\v 20 He said to her, “Stand at the entrance to the tent. If anyone comes and asks you and
says, “Is  any man here?” then say, “No.”
 
\s5
\v 21 Then Jael Heber’s wife took a tent peg and a hammer in her hand and went softly to him, and drove the tent peg into his temple; it pierced through him into the ground, for he was in a deep sleep; so died.
\v 22 Behold, as Barak was pursuing Sisera, Jael came out to meet him and said to him, “Come and I will show you the man whom you are looking for.” He came to her, and, behold, Sisera lay dead, and the tent peg was in his temple.
 
\s5
\p
\v 23 So God subdued on that day Jabin, the king of Canaan, before the people of Israel.
\v 24 The hand of the people of Israel kept defeating Jabin, the king of Canaan, until they destroyed him.




\s5
\c 5
\p
\v 1 Then Deborah and Barak, the son of Abinoam, sang on that day:
\q
\v 2 “Because the leaders took the lead in Israel,
\q Because the people offered themselves willingly,
\q We praise you, Yahweh.
 
\s5
\q
\v 3 Listen, you kings; pay attention, you leaders;
\q I, I, will sing to Yahweh;
\q I will sing praise to Yahweh, the God of Israel.
\q
\v 4 Yahweh, when you went from Seir,
\q When you marched out of the land of Edom,
\q The earth trembled, and the heavens also dropped rain;
\q Indeed, the clouds dropped water.
 
\s5
\q
\v 5 The mountains quaked at Yahweh's presence;
\q Even Sinai quaked at the presence of Yahweh, the God of Israel.
\b
\q
\v 6 In the days of Shamgar, the son of Anath,
\q In the days of Jael, the main roads were untraveled;
\q The travelers went by lesser roads.
 
\s5
\q
\v 7 Leaders ceased in Israel, they ceased,
\q Until I, Deborah, arose;
\q I, a mother in Israel, arose.
\q
\v 8 Israel chose new gods;
\q Then there was war in the city gates:
\q Was a shield or spear seen
\q Among forty thousand soldiers in Israel?
 
\s5
\q
\v 9 My heart turns toward the leaders of Israel
\q Who offered themselves willingly among the people.
\q We bless you, Yahweh.
\q
\v 10 Tell of it, you who ride on white donkeys,
\q You who sit on rugs for saddles,
\q You who pass by.
 
\s5
\q
\v 11 Far from the noise of archers, in the places where they draw water,
\q There they will tell again of Yahweh’s righteous deeds,
\q The righteous actions of his rule in Israel.
\q Then the people of Yahweh went down to the city gates.
\b
 
\s5
\q
\v 12 Awake, awake, Deborah;
\q Awake, awake, sing a song.
\q Arise, Barak, son of Abinoam, and lead away your captives.
\q
\v 13 Then a remnant of the nobles and the people came down to battle;
\q Yahweh came down for me against the mighty enemy.
 
\s5
\q
\v 14 Out of Ephraim those whose root is in Amalek came down;
\q After you, Benjamin, among your peoples;
\q Out of Machir came down leaders,
\q And out of Zebulun those who carry an officer's staff.
 
\s5
\q
\v 15 The princes of Issachar were with Deborah;
\q As was Issachar, so was Barak;
\q Into the valley they rushed after his steps.
\q By the streams of Reuben
\q There was great searching of heart.
 
\s5
\q
\v 16 Why did you sit among the sheepfolds?
\q To hear the shepherds whistle for their flocks?
\q At the streams of Reuben
\q There was great searching of heart.
 
\s5
\q
\v 17 Gilead stayed beyond the Jordan;
\q And why did Dan stay on the seacost?
\q Asher remained by the sea
\q And stayed by his streams.
\q
\v 18 Zebulun was a tribe that risked their lives to the death;
\q Naphtali attacked on the battlefield.
\b
 
\s5
\q
\v 19 The kings came and fought;
\q The kings of Canaan fought;
\q In Taanach by the waters of Megiddo,
\q But they found no silver for booty.
\q
\v 20 Tthe stars fought from the heavens;
\q From their courses they fought against Sisera.
 
\s5
\q
\v 21 The river Kishon swept the enemy away,
\q That ancient river, the river Kishon.
\q O my soul, march on with strength.
\q
\v 22 Then the horses stamped their feet
\q Because the strong steeds rushed about. 
\s5
\q
\v 23 'May you, Meroz, be cursed,' said the angel of Yahweh.
\q 'I bitterly curse your inhabitants
\q Because they did not come to help Yahweh,
\q To help Yahweh against the mighty enemy.'
\b
 
\s5
\q
\v 24 Jael is blessed more than all other women,
\q Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite;
\q She is more blessed than all other women in tents.
\q
\v 25 The man asked water, and she gave him milk;
\q She brought him butter in a dish fit for princes.
 
\s5
\q
\v 26 She put her hand to the tent peg,
\q Her right hand to the workman’s hammer;
\q With the hammer she struck down Sisera, she struck down through his head;
\q Indeed, she pierced through his temples and struck him down.
\q
\v 27 At her feet he bowed, he fell, and he lay;
\q At her feet he bowed and fell;
\q Where he bowed, there he fell down dead.
\b
 
\s5
\q
\v 28 Through a window a woman was looking out and cried out;
\q The mother of Sisera cried through the lattice,
\q ‘Why is his chariot so long in coming?
\q Why do the wheels of his chariots delay?’
 
\s5
\q
\v 29 A wise lady answered her—
\q Indeed, she gave this answer to herself:
\q
\v 30 ‘Have they not found plunder, have they not divided the spoil?
\q A girl, two girls for every man;
\q Booty of dyed clothing for Sisera,
\q Booty of dyed and embroidered clothing,
\q Of dyed clothing embroidered on both sides, on the necks of the spoil?’
 
\s5
\q
\v 31 May all your enemies perish in this way, O Yahweh!
\q But let those who love him be like the sun when it goes forth in its strength.”
\p Then the land had rest for forty years.





\s5
\c 6
\p
\v 1 The people of Israel did what was evil in Yahweh’s sight, and he gave them over into the hand of
Midian seven years.
\v 2 The hand of Midian dominated Israel; because of Midian, the people of Israel made themselves hideouts in the mountains, caves, and strongholds.
 
\s5
\v 3 So it was, when Israel sowed seed in their fields, that the Midianites would come up, as well as the Amalekites and the people from the east; they would come up against the Israelites;
\v 4 they would set up camp and destroy the earth’s harvest, as far as Gaza, and they would leave no food 
in Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor donkey.
 
\s5
\v 5 For they would come up with their cattle and their tents; they would come in as many as locusts; both they and their camels were
without number; they would come into the land to destroy it.
\v 6 Israel was brought very low because of Midian, and the people of Israel cried to Yahweh.
 
\s5
\p
\v 7 It came about, when the people of Israel cried to Yahweh because of Midian,
\v 8 that Yahweh sent a prophet to the people of Israel; he said to them, “This is what Yahweh, the God of Israel, says: ‘I
brought you up from Egypt, and brought you out of the house of slavery.
 
\s5
\v 9 I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all who were oppressing you. I drove them out
from before you, and I gave you their land.
\v 10 I said to you, 'I am Yahweh your God; you must not fear the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you are living.' But you have not listened to my voice.”
 
\s5
\p
\v 11 Now the angel of Yahweh came and sat under the oak that was at Ophrah, which belonged to Joash, the Abiezrite. His son Gideon was beating out wheat in the winepress to hide it from the Midianites.
\v 12 The angel of Yahweh appeared to him and said to him, “Yahweh is with you, you mighty man of courage.”
 
\s5
\v 13 Gideon said to him, “Oh, my lord, if Yahweh is with us, why then has all this happened to us? Where are all his marvelous deeds that our fathers told us of when they said, ‘Did not Yahweh bring us up from Egypt?’ But now Yahweh has abandoned us and delivered us into the hand of Midian.”
 
\s5
\v 14 Yahweh looked at him and said, “Go in this strength of yours and save Israel from the hand of Midian; have I not sent you?”
\v 15 Gideon said to him, “Oh, Lord, what can I save Israel with? See, my family is the poorest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father’s house.”
 
\s5
\v 16 Yahweh said to him, “I will certainly be with you, and you will attack the Midianites as if they were one man.”
\v 17 Gideon said to him, “If I have found favor in your sight, then give me a sign that it is you who are talking with me.
\v 18 Do not leave here, I beg you, until I come to you and bring my gift and lay it before you.” Yahweh said, “I will wait until you come back.”
 
\s5
\p
\v 19 Gideon went and prepared a young goat and unleavened cakes made wtih an ephah of flour; he put the meat into a basket, and he
put the broth in a pot. Then he brought it all out to the angel under the oak tree and presented it.
\v 20 The angel of God said to him, “Take the meat and the unleavened cakes and put them on this rock, and pour out the broth over them.” Gideon did so.
 
\s5
\v 21 Then the angel of Yahweh stretched out the end of the staff that was in his hand, and he touched the flesh and the unleavened
cakes; a fire went up out of the rock and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes. Then the angel of Yahweh
departed out of Gideon’s sight.
 
\s5
\v 22 Gideon saw that this was the angel of Yahweh; Gideon said, “Alas, O Lord Yahweh! For I have seen the
angel of Yahweh face to face!”
\v 23 Yahweh said to him, “May peace be to you; fear not; you will not die.”
\v 24 Then Gideon built an altar there to Yahweh; he called it Yahwehshalom: to this day it is still in Ophrah of the
Abiezrites.
 
\s5
\p
\v 25 It came about the same night that Yahweh said to him, “Take your father’s bull and another bull, one that is seven
years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that your father has, and cut down the Asherah pole that is beside it;
\v 26 build an altar to Yahweh your God on top of this stronghold in the approved manner, and take the second
bull and offer a burnt offering with the wood of the Asherah pole that you will have cut down.”
 
\s5
\v 27 Then Gideon took ten of his servants and did as Yahweh had spoken to him. It came about, because he feared
his father’s household and the men of the city, that he did not do it by day, so he did it by night.
 
\s5
\p
\v 28 When the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was broken down, and the Asherah pole that had been beside it was cut down, and the second bull had been offered on the altar that was built.
\v 29 The men of the city said to each other, “Who has done this?”  When they inquired and asked, others said, “Gideon, the son of
Joash, has done this thing.”
 
\s5
\v 30 Then the men of the city said to Joash, “Bring out your son so that he may die, because he has broken down the altar of Baal, and because he has cut down the Asherah pole that was beside it.”
 
\s5
\v 31 Joash said to all who stood against him, “Will you really fight for Baal? Will you save him? Whoever fights for him, let him be put to death while it is still morning. If Baal is a god, let him fight for himself, because someone has broken down his altar.”
\v 32 Therefore on that day he called Gideon Jerubbaal, saying, “Let Baal fight against him, because he has broken down his altar.”
 
\s5
\p
\v 33 Then all the Midianites, Amalekites, and the people of the east gathered together; they crossed over and camped in the valley of Jezreel.
 
\s5
\v 34 But the spirit of Yahweh came on Gideon; he blew a trumpet, and the clan of Abiezer gathered together to follow him.
\v 35 He sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; they also gathered together to follow him. He sent messengers
to Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali; they came up to meet him.
 
\s5
\p
\v 36 Gideon said to God, “If you will truly save Israel by my hand, as you have said,
\v 37 see, I will put a woolen fleece on the threshing floor; if dew comes only on the fleece, and it is dry on all the surrounding ground, then I will know that you will save Israel by my hand, as you have said.”
 
\s5
\v 38 It happened like this. For Gideon rose up early the next morning, pressed the fleece together, and wrung the dew out of the fleece, a bowlful of water.
 
\s5
\v 39 Then Gideon said to God, “May your anger not be kindled against me, and I will speak only one time more; let me make another test, I beg you, just once more with the fleece. Now let it be dry only on the fleece, and let there be dew on all the surrounding ground.”
\v 40 God did so that night; for it was dry only on the fleece, and there was dew on all the surrounding ground.
 





\s5
\c 7
\p
\v 1 Then Jerubbaal, that is, Gideon, and all the people who were with him, rose up early and camped beside the spring of Harod. The camp of Midian was to their north, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.
 
\s5
\p
\v 2 Yahweh said to Gideon, “The people who are with you are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hand; otherwise, Israel may be proud of themselves against me, saying, ‘My own hand has saved me.’
\v 3 Now therefore, proclaim in the ears of the people and say, ‘Whoever is afraid, whoever trembles, let him return and depart from Mount Gilead.’” So twenty-two thousand people went away; ten thousand remained.
 
\s5
\p
\v 4 Yahweh said to Gideon, “The people are still too many; bring them down to the water, and I will test them for you there. It will happen that those of whom I say to you, ‘This one will go with you,’ he will go with you; and of whomever I say to you, ‘This one will not go with you,’ he will not go.”
 
\s5
\v 5 So Gideon brought down the people to the water; and Yahweh said to him, “Everyone who laps from the water with his tongue, as a dog laps, him you put apart from the others; likewise, everyone who kneels down to drink.”
\v 6 The number of those who lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, was three hundred men; all the rest of the people knelt to drink water.
 
\s5
\v 7 Yahweh said to Gideon, “By means of the three hundred men who lapped I will save you and deliver the Midianites into your hand; let all the rest of the people go, every man, to his home.”
\v 8 So the people took food in their hand and their trumpets; Gideon sent all the men of Israel, every man to his home,
but kept the three hundred men. Now the camp of Midian was beneath him in the valley.
 
\s5
\p
\v 9 It came about the same night that Yahweh said to him, “Arise, attack the camp; for I have delivered it into your hand.
\v 10 But if you are afraid to attack, go first with Purah, your servant, down to the camp.
\v 11 You will hear what they say, and afterward your hands will be strengthened to attack the camp.” Then Gideon went down with Purah, his servant, to the outermost part of the soldiers who were in the camp.
 
\s5
\v 12 The Midianites. the Amalekites. and all the people of the east lay along in the valley like locusts in their numbers; and their camels were without number, as the grains of sand that are on the seashore for their number.
 
\s5
\v 13 When Gideon had come, behold, there was a man telling a dream to his companion; the man said, “See, I had a dream; see, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the camp of Midian, came to the tent, and struck down it so that it fell; it turned it upside down so that the tent lay flat.”
\v 14 His companion answered and said, “This is nothing else but the sword of Gideon, the son of Joash, a man of Israe. God has delivered Midian and all the army into his hand.”
 
\s5
\p
\v 15 It happened when Gideon heard the account of the dream and its interpretation, that he worshiped Yahweh; he returned into the camp of Israel and said, “Arise, for Yahweh has delivered the army of Midian into your hand.”
\v 16 He divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put trumpets in the hands of them all, and empty pitchers, with torches inside the pitchers. 
\s5
\v 17 He said to them, “Look at me and do the same as I do; see, when I come to the outermost part of the camp, as I do, so you must do.
\v 18 When I blow the trumpet, I and all who are with me, then blow your trumpets also on every side of the entire camp and say, “For Yahweh and for Gideon!”
 
\s5
\p
\v 19 So Gideon and the hundred men who were with him came to the outermost part of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch, just after the Midianites had posted the new watch; they blew the trumpets and broke in pieces the pitchers that were in their hands.
 
\s5
\v 20 The three companies blew the trumpets, broke the pitchers, and held the torches in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right hands to blow them. They shouted, “The sword of Yahweh and of Gideon.”
\v 21 They stood every man in his place around the camp. All the Midianite army ran; Gideon’s men shouted and put
them to flight.
 
\s5
\v 22 Gideon’s men blew the three hundred trumpets, and Yahweh set every Midianite man’s sword against the other and against the whole army; the army fled as far as Bethshittah toward Zererah, as far as the border of Abelmeholah, by Tabbath.
\v 23 The men of Israel gathered together from Naphtali, Asher, and all Manasseh, and pursued Midian.
 
\s5
\p
\v 24 Gideon sent messengers throughout all the hill country of Ephraim, saying, “Come down against Midian and take control of the Jordan River, as far as Bethbarah, to stop them.” So all the men of Ephraim gathered together and take control of the streams, as far as Bethbarah and the Jordan River.
\v 25 They took the two princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb; they killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and they killed Zeeb at the winepress of Zeeb; they pursued Midian, and they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon by the Jordan.
 




\s5
\c 8
\p
\v 1 The men of Ephraim said to Gideon, “Why have you treated us badky? You did not call us when you went to fight
with Midian.” They criticized him sharply on this matter.
 
\s5
\v 2 He said to them, “What have I now done in comparison with you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better
than the vintage of Abiezer?
\v 3 God has delivered into your hand the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb! What was I able to do in comparison with you?”
Their anger toward him died down when he said that.
 
\s5
\p
\v 4 Gideon came to the Jordan and passed over, he and the three hundred men who were with him, weak, yet still 
pursuing the enemy.
\v 5 He said to the men of Succoth, “I beg you, give loaves of bread to the people who are following me; for they are weak,
and I am pursuing Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian.”
 
\s5
\v 6 The leaders of Succoth said, “Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand, that we should give bread to your
army?”
\v 7 Gideon said, “When Yahweh has delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, I will tear your flesh with
the thorns of the wilderness and with briers.”
 
\s5
\v 8 He went up from there to Penuel and spoke to the people there in the same way, but the men of Penuel answered him as the men of
Succoth had answered.
\v 9 He spoke also to the men of Penuel and said, “When I come again in peace, I will tear down this tower.”
 
\s5
\p
\v 10 Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their army with them, about fifteen thousand men, all who were left of all
the army of the people of the east; for 120,000 men who drew the sword had fallen.
 
\s5
\v 11 Gideon attacked by the road leading to the nomads, who lived in tents to the east of Nobah and Jogbehah. He struck down the enemy army, for the enemy was surprised.
\v 12 Zebah and Zalmunna fled. Gideon pursued them; he took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and set their whole army into a panic.
 
\s5
\p
\v 13 Gideon, the son of Joash, returned from the battle from the ascent to Heres.
\v 14 He caught a young man of the people of Succoth and inquired of him; the young man described for him the leaders of Succoth and its elders, seventy-seven men.
 
\s5
\v 15 Gideon came back to the men of Succoth and said, “Look at Zebah and Zalmunna, about whom you mocked me and said, ‘Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna already in your hand, that we should give bread to your men who are weary?’”
\v 16 Gideon took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he punished the men of Succoth.
\v 17 He also tore down the tower of Penuel and killed the men of that city.
 
\s5
\p
\v 18 Then Gideon said to Zebah and Zalmunna, “What kind of men were they whom you killed at Tabor?” They answered, “They were like you: each one looked like a son of a king.”
\v 19 Gideon said, “They were my brothers, the sons of my mother. As Yahweh lives, if you had saved them alive, I would not kill you.”
 
\s5
\v 20 He said to Jether, his firstborn, “Get up and kill them!” But the youth did not draw his sword; for he was afraid, because he was still a youth.
\v 21 Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, “Rise yourself and fall on us; for as the man is, so is his strength.” Gideon rose and killed Zebah and Zalmunna; he also took the crescent ornaments that were on their camels’ necks.
 
\s5
\p
\v 22 Then the men of Israel said to Gideon, “Rule over us, you, your son, and your son’s son also; for you have
saved us from the hand of Midian.”
\v 23 Gideon said to them, “I will not rule over you, neither will my son rule over you. Yahweh will rule over you.”
 
\s5
\v 24 Gideon said to them, “I would like to make a request of you, that you would give me every man the earrings from his booty." (For the Midianites had golden earrings because they were Ishmaelites.)
\v 25 They answered, “We will willingly give them to you.” They spread a garment and every man threw onto it the earrings from his booty.
 
\s5
\v 26 The weight of the golden earrings that he requested was 1,700 shekels of gold; this booty was in addition to the crescent ornaments, the pendants, and the purple clothing that was on the kings of Midian, and
in addition to the chains that had been around their camels’ necks.
 
\s5
\v 27 Gideon made an ephod with the earrings and put it in his city, in Ophrah; and all Israel acted as prostitute, worshiping it
there; it became a trap for Gideon and his house.
\v 28 So Midian was subdued before the people of Israel and were no longer proud. The land had rest forty
years in the days of Gideon.
 
\s5
\p
\v 29 Jerubbaal, the son of Joash, went and lived in his own house.
\v 30 Gideon fathered seventy sons, for he had many wives.
\v 31 His concubine, who was in Shechem, also bore him a son, and Gideon called his name Abimelech.
 
\s5
\v 32 Gideon, the son of Joash, died at a good old age and was buried in the tomb of Joash. his father, in Ophrah of the
Abiezrites.
\p
\v 33 It came about, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the people of Israel turned again and acted as a prostitute, worshiping the Baals; they made Baalberith their god.
 
\s5
\v 34 The people of Israel no longer cared for Yahweh, their God, who had delivered them out of the hand of all their enemies on every side;
\v 35 neither did they show any loyalty to the house of Jerubbaal, who was Gideon, in return for all the goodness that he had shown to Israel.




\s5
\c 9
\p
\v 1 Abimelech, the son of Jerubbaal, went to his mother’s brothers at Shechem; he spoke with them and with all the
family of the house of his mother’s father, saying,
\v 2 “I beg you, say to the ears of all the men of Shechem: ‘Is it better for you that all the sons of Jerubbaal, who
are seventy persons, rule over you, or that only one person should rule over you?’ Remember that I also am your bone and your flesh.”
 
\s5
\v 3 His mother’s brothers said about him all these words to the ears of all the men of Shechem; their hearts were inclined to
follow Abimelech, for they said, “He is our brother.”
\v 4 They gave him seventy pieces of silver out of the house of Baalberith, with which Abimelech hired
worthless and reckless fellows, who then followed him.
 
\s5
\v 5 He went to his father’s house at Ophrah and killed his brothers, the sons of Jerubbaal, seventy 
persons, on one stone, except that Jotham, the youngest son of Jerubbaal, was omitted, for he had hidden himself.
\v 6 All the men of Shechem assembled together, and all of Bethmillo; they went and made Abimelech king besde the oak of the pillar that was in Shechem.
 
\s5
\p
\v 7 When people told this to Jotham, he went and stood on the top of Mount Gerizim; he shouted and cried out, saying to them, “Listen to me, you men of Shechem, so that God may listen to you.
\v 8 The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them; they said to the olive tree, ‘Reign over us.’
 
\s5
\v 9 But the olive tree said to them, ‘Should I leave my prosperity with which they use me to honor God and man, and go to wave back and forth over the trees?’
\v 10 The trees said to the fig tree, ‘Come and reign over us.’
\v 11 But the fig tree said to them, ‘Should I leave my sweetness and my good fruit, and go to wave back and forth over the trees?’
 
\s5
\v 12 The trees said to the vine, ‘Come and reign over us.’
\v 13 The vine said to them, ‘Should I leave my new wine, which cheers God and man, and go to wave back and forth over the trees?’
\v 14 Then said all the trees to the bramble, ‘Come and reign over us.’
 
\s5
\v 15 The bramble said to the trees, ‘If indeed you anoint me as king over you, then come and take refuge in my shade; but
if not, let fire come out of the bramble and devour the cedars of Lebanon.’
\v 16 Now therefore, if you have dealt truly and uprightly, in that you have made Abimelech king, and if you have dealt well with
Jerubbaal and his house, and have done to him according to the deserving of his hands—
 
\s5
\v 17 (for my father fought for you, risked his life, and delivered you out of the hand of Midian;
\v 18 but today you have risen up against my father’s house and have killed his sons, seventy persons, on one
stone; you have made Abimelech, the son of his female servant, king over the men of Shechem, because he is your brother).
 
\s5
\v 19 If you have dealt today truly and righteously with Jerubbaal and with his house, then rejoice over Abimelech, and let him also rejoice over you;
\v 20 but if not, let fire come out from Abimelech and devour the men of Shechem and the house of Millo; and let fire come
out from the men of Shechem and from the house of Millo, to devour Abimelech.”
\v 21 Jotham ran away and fled, and went to Beer; he lived there for fear of Abimelech, his brother.
 
\s5
\p
\v 22 Abimelech was leader over Israel for three years.
\v 23 God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem, and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with
Abimelech.
\v 24 This happened so that the violence done to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might come back, and that their blood might be laid upon
Abimelech their brother, who had killed them, and upon the men of Shechem, who had strengthened his hands to kill his brothers.
 
\s5
\v 25 So the men of Shechem placed some men to lie in wait on the mountaintops, and they robbed all who came along that way by them; this was told to Abimelech.
 
\s5
\p
\v 26 Gaal, the son of Ebed, came with his brothers and went over to Shechem; the men of Shechem put their trust in him.
\v 27 They went out into the field, gathered their vineyards’ fruit, trampled on 
the grapes, and held a festival; they and went into the house of their god, ate and drank, and and cursed Abimelech.
 
\s5
\v 28 Gaal, the son of Ebed, said, “Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? Is he not the son of
Jerubbaal? And is not Zebul his officer? You are serving the men of Hamor, Shechem’s father, but why should we serve him?
\v 29 I wish that this people were under my hand! Then would I remove Abimelech. I would tell Abimelech, ‘Bring your army out to fight.’”
 
\s5
\p
\v 30 When Zebul, the ruler of the city, heard the words of Gaal, the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled.
\v 31 He sent messengers to Abimelech with deceit; they said to him, “See, Gaal the son of Ebed and his brothers have come to
Shechem; and, see, they are persuading the city to take part against you.
 
\s5
\v 32 Now therefore, get up by night, you and the people who are with you, and lie in wait in the fields;
\v 33 it will happen in the morning, as soon as the sun is up, that you will rise early and rush on the city; and,
see, when he and the people who are with him come out against you, then may you do to them as you will find
occasion.”
 
\s5
\p
\v 34 Abimelech and all the people who were with him rose up by night, and they laid wait against Shechem in four
companies.
\v 35 Gaal, the son of Ebed, went out, and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city; Abimelech and the
people who were with him rose up and attacked from their hiding place.
 
\s5
\v 36 When Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, “See, there come people down from the tops of the mountains.” Zebul said to him, “You see the shadows of the mountains as if they were men.”
\v 37 Gaal spoke again and said, “See, people are coming down by the middle of the land, and one group is coming by the way of the oak of the diviners.”
 
\s5
\v 38 Then Zebul said to him, “Where is your mouth now, you who said, ‘Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him?’ Is this not the people whom you have despised? Attack now, I beg you, and fight with them.”
\v 39 Gaal went out leading the men of Shechem and fought with Abimelech.
\v 40 Abimelech chased him, and Gaal fled before him, and many fell wounded, up to the entrance to the city gate.
 
\s5
\p
\v 41 Abimelech lived at Arumah, and Zebul drove out Gaal and his brothers, so that they could not live in Shechem.
\v 42 It came about on the next day that the people went out into the field; others told this to Abimelech.
\v 43 He took his people, divided them into three groups, and lay wait in the fields. He looked, and, see,
the people came out of the city; he rose up against them and struck them down.
 
\s5
\v 44 Abimelech and the groups who were with him rushed forward and stood in the entrance of the city gate;
the other two groups rushed upon all who were in the field and struck down them.
\v 45 Abimelech fought against the city all that day; he took the city, and killed the people who were in it; he
leveled the city and sowed it with salt.
 
\s5
\p
\v 46 When all the men of the tower of Shechem heard about this, they went into the stronghold of the house of Elberith.
\v 47 Abimelech was told that all the men of the tower of Shechem had gathered together.
 
\s5
\v 48 Abimelech went up to Mount Zalmon, he and all the people who were with him; Abimelech took an axe in his
hand and cut down a bough from the trees, took it up, and laid it on his shoulder. He said to the people who were
with him, “What you have seen me do, hurry and do as I have done.”
\v 49 In the same way, all the people cut down every man his bough and followed Abimelech. They placed them against the stronghold, and set
the stronghold on fire with them. In this way, all the men in the tower of Shechem also died, about one thousand men and women.
 
\s5
\p
\v 50 Then Abimelech went to Thebez, set up cam to attack it, and captured it.
\v 51 But there was a strong tower in the city, and all the men and women and all those in the city fled into it and shut
themselves in. Then they went up to the tower’s roof.
 
\s5
\v 52 Abimelech came to the tower and fought against it, and went up to the door of the tower to burn it.
\v 53 But a woman threw down an upper millstone on Abimelech’s head and broke his skull.
\v 54 Then he called in a hurry to the young man who was his armor bearer; he said to him, “Draw your sword and kill me, so that men may no say of me, ‘A woman killed him.’”  So his young man thrust him through, and he died.
 
\s5
\v 55 When the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed every man to his home.
\v 56 In this way, God paid back the wickedness of Abimelech that he had done to his father in killing his seventy brothers.
\v 57 God paid back all the wickedness of the men of Shechem on their own heads; on them came the curse of Jotham, the son of Jerubbaal.
 




\s5
\c 10
\p
\v 1 After Abimelech, Tola the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar arose to save Israel; he lived in
Shamir, in the hill country of Ephraim.
\v 2 He judged Israel twenty-three years, died, and was buried in Shamir.
 
\s5
\p
\v 3 After him arose Jair, the Gileadite; he judged Israel twenty-two years.
\v 4 He had thirty sons who rode on thirty young donkeys; they had thirty cities, which are called Havvothjair to this day; these are in the land of Gilead.
\v 5 Jair died and was buried in Kamon.
 
\s5
\p
\v 6 The people of Israel again did what was evil in the sight of Yahweh and worshiped the  Baals, the
Ashtars, the gods of Aram, the gods of Sidon, the gods of Moab, the gods of the people of Ammon, and the
gods of the Philistines; they forsook Yahweh and worshiped him no longer.
\v 7 The anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of the Philistines and into the hand
of the people of Ammon.
 
\s5
\v 8 They shattered and crushed the people of Israel that year. Then for eighteen years they oppressed all the people of Israel who were beyond the Jordan in the land of the Amorites, that is, in Gilead.
\v 9 The people of Ammon also crossed over the Jordan to fight against Judah, against Benjamin, and against the house
of Ephraim; so that Israel was very distressed.
 
\s5
\p
\v 10 Then the people of Israel cried out to Yahweh, saying, “We have sinned against you, because we have forsaken our God and have worshiped the Baals.”
\v 11 Yahweh said to the people of Israel, “Did I not save you from the Egyptians, from the Amorites, from the people of Ammon, and from the Philistines?
\v 12 The Sidonians also, and the Amalekites and the Maonites oppressed you; you cried out to me, and I saved you out of their hand.
 
\s5
\v 13 Yet you forsook me again and worshiped other gods; so I will save you no more.
\v 14 Go and cry to the gods that you have chosen; let them save you in the time of your distress.”
 
\s5
\v 15 The people of Israel said to Yahweh, “We have sinned; do to us whatever seems good to you; only
deliver us today, we beg you.”
\v 16 They got rid of the foreign gods from among them and worshiped Yahweh; and his soul was grieved for Israel’s  misery.
 
\s5
\p
\v 17 Then the people of Ammon gathered together and camped in Gilead. The people of Israel assembled
themselves together and camped at Mizpah.
\v 18 The princes of the people of Gilead said one to another, “Which man is he who will begin to fight against the people of Ammon? He will be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.”
 




\s5
\c 11
\p
\v 1 Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of courage; he was the son of a prostitute; and Gilead was his father.
\v 2 Gilead’s wife bore him sons; when his wife’s sons grew up, they drove Jephthah out and said to him, “You will
not inherit in our father’s house, for you are the son of another woman.”
\v 3 Then Jephthah fled from his brothers and lived in the land of Tob; worthless men gathered to Jephthah, and
they followed him whereever he went.
 
\s5
\p
\v 4 It came about sometime later, that the people of Ammon waged war against Israel.
\v 5 It happened that, when the people of Ammon made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah out 
of the land of Tob;
\v 6 they said to Jephthah, “Come and be our leader so that we may fight with the people of Ammon.”
 
\s5
\v 7 Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, “Did not you hate me and drive me out of my father’s house? Why do you come to me now when you are in distress?”
\v 8 The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, “We are turning to you now so that you may go with us and
fight with the people of Ammon. You will be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.”
 
\s5
\v 9 Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, “If you bring me home again to fight with the people of Ammon, and if Yahweh delivers them before me, will I be your head?”
\v 10 The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, “May Yahweh be witness between us! We will certainly act according to everything you say.”
\v 11 Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and chief over them; Jephthah said all his words again before Yahweh in Mizpah.
 
\s5
\p
\v 12 Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the people of Ammon, saying, “What have you to do with me, that you have come to me to fight against my land?”
\v 13 The king of the people of Ammon answered to the messengers of Jephthah, “Because Israel took away my land, when he
came up out of Egypt, from the Arnon to the Jabbok, and to the Jordan; now therefore, restore those
lands again in peace.”
 
\s5
\v 14 Jephthah sent messengers again to the king of the people of Ammon;
\v 15 he said to him, “This is what Jephthah says: ‘Israel did not take away the land of Moab, nor the land of the people of Ammon;
\v 16 instead, they came up from Egypt, and Israel went through the wilderness to the Red Sea and came to Kadesh.
 
\s5
\v 17 Then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, “Let me, I beg you, pass through your land,” but the king of
Edom did not listen. In the same manner, he sent messengers to the king of Moab; but he refused. So Israel stayed at Kadesh.
\v 18 Then they went through the wilderness and went around the land of Edom and the land of Moab, and came by the east side
of the land of Moab. They camped on the other side of the Arnon, but they did not come inside the borders of Moab, for the Arnon was the border of Moab.
 
\s5
\v 19 Israel sent messengers to Sihon, king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; Israel said to him, ‘Let us pass,
we beg you, through your land to my place.’
\v 20 But Sihon did not trust Israel to pass through his border; Sihon gathered all his people together, camped at
Jahaz, and fought against Israel.
 
\s5
\v 21 Yahweh, the God of Israel, delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they struck them down, so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country.
\v 22 They possessed all the border of the Amorites, from the Arnon to the Jabbok, and from the wilderness to
the Jordan.
 
\s5
\v 23 So now Yahweh, the God of Israel, has dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel, and should you possess them instead?
\v 24 Will you not possess what Chemosh, your god, gives you to possess? So whoever Yahweh our God has dispossessed from before us, we will possess their land.
\v 25 Now are you any better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he ever struggle against Israel? Did he
ever fight against them?
 
\s5
\v 26 While Israel lived for three hundred years in Heshbon and its towns, and in Aroer and its towns, and in all the cities that are along by the side
of the Arnon—why then did you not recover them within that time?
\v 27 So I have not sinned against you, but you do me wrong to war against me. May Yahweh, the Judge, be judge today between the people of Israel and the people of Ammon.”
\v 28 However, the king of the people of Ammon did not listen to the message that Jephthah sent him.
 
\s5
\p
\v 29 Then the spirit of Yahweh came on Jephthah, and he passed through Gilead and Manasseh, and passed through Mizpeh of Gilead,
and from Mizpeh of Gilead he went to attack the people of Ammon.
\v 30 Jephthah made a vow to Yahweh and said, “If you indeed deliver the people of Ammon into my hand,
\v 31 then it will be that whatever comes out from the doors of my house to meet me when I return in peace from the
people of Ammon, it will belong to Yahweh, and I will offer it up as a burnt offering.”
 
\s5
\v 32 So Jephthah passed over to the people of Ammon to fight against them, and Yahweh delivered them into his hand.
\v 33 He struck them down with a very great
slaughter from Aroer as far as Minnith, twenty cities, and to Abelkeramim. So the people of Ammon were subdued by the people of Israel.
 
\s5
\p
\v 34 Jephthah came to Mizpah, to his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with tambourines and with dancing; she was his only child; except for her he had neither son nor daughter.
\v 35 It came about, when he saw her, that he tore his clothes and said, “Alas, my daughter! You have brought me very
low, and you are one of them who trouble me; for I have spoken to Yahweh, and I cannot go back on my word.”
 
\s5
\v 36 She said to him, “My father, you have spoken to Yahweh; do to me according to what has
come out of your mouth, because Yahweh has taken vengeance for you on your enemies, the people of Ammon.”
\v 37 She said to her father, “Let this be done for me: let me alone for two months, that I may leave and go down to the mountains and lament my virginity, I and my companions.”
 
\s5
\v 38 He said, “Go.” He sent her away for two months; she departed, she and her companions, and lamented her
virginity in the mountains.
\v 39 It came about at the end of two months, that she returned to her father, who did with her in accordance to the vow
that he had made; now she never slept with a man. And it became a custom in Israel 
\v 40 that the daughters of Israel would commemorate every year the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite for four days.
 




\s5
\c 12
\p
\v 1 The men of Ephraim gathered together and passed over to Zaphon; they said to Jephthah, “Why did you go to fight against the people of Ammon but did not call us to go with you? We will burn your house down on you.”
\v 2 Jephthah said to them, “I and my people were in a great struggle with the people of Ammon; when I called you, you did not save out me from their hand.
 
\s5
 
\v 3 When I saw that you did not save me, I took my life into my own hands and went against the people of Ammon, and Yahweh delivered them into my hand. Is that why you have come up to me today to fight against me?”
\v 4 Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead and fought with Ephraim; the men of Gilead struck Ephraim down, because the men of Ephraim had said to them, “You are fugitives in Ephraim, you Gileadites, in the midst of Ephraim and in the midst of Manasseh.”
 
\s5
\v 5 The Gileadites captured the fords of the Jordan and held them against the Ephraimites. It happened that when
any of the fugitives of Ephraim said, “Let me go over the river,” the men of Gilead would say to him, “Are you an Ephraimite?” If he said, “No,”
\v 6 then they would say to him, “Say ‘Shibboleth;’ the man would say ‘Sibboleth,’ for he could not pronounce the word right. Then the Gileadites would seize him and kill him at the fords of the Jordan. And forty-two thousand Ephraimites fell at that time.
 
\s5
\p
\v 7 Jephthah judged Israel for six years. Then Jephthah the Gileadite died and was buried in one of the cities of Gilead.
 
\s5
\p
\v 8 After him, Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel.
\v 9 He had thirty sons; he sent thirty daughters he sent away, and he brought thirty daughters of other men in from other places for his sons. He judged Israel for seven years.
 
\s5
\v 10 Ibzan died and was buried at Bethlehem.
\v 11 After him, Elon the Zebulunite judged Israel; he judged Israel for ten years.
\v 12 Elon the Zebulunite died and was buried in Aijalon, in the land of Zebulun.
 
\s5
\p
\v 13 After him, Abdon, the son of Hillel the Pirathonite, judged Israel.
\v 14 He had forty sons and thirty grandsons; they rode on seventy young donkeys; and he judged Israel for eight years.
\v 15  Abdon, the son of Hillel the Pirathonite, died and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the hill country
of the Amalekites.





\s5
\c 13
\p
\v 1 The people of Israel again did what was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and he delivered them into the hand
of the Philistines for forty years.
\p
\v 2 There was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; his wife was barren; she had no children.
 
\s5
\v 3 The angel of Yahweh appeared to this woman and said to her, “See now, you have been barren, and have had no children, but you will conceive and bear a son.
\v 4 Now therefore be careful, I beg you, and drink no wine or strong drink, and eat no unclean thing.
\v 5 For, see, you have, in fact, conceived; you will bear a son; no razor must come on his head, for the child will be a Nazirite
for God from your womb. He will begin to save Israel from the hand of the Philistines.”
 
\s5
\v 6 Then the woman came and told her husband; she said, “A man of God came to me, and his face was like the face of the angel of God, very fearsome. I did not ask him where he came from, and he did not tell him his name.
\v 7 But he said to me, “See, you have conceived, and you will bear a son; now drink no wine or strong drink, and eat no
unclean thing, for the child will be a Nazirite for God from your womb to the day of his death.”
 
\s5
\p
\v 8 Then Manoah pleaded wtih Yahweh and said, “Oh, Lord, I beg you, let the man of God whom you sent come to
us again and teach us what we must do for the child who will be born.”
\v 9 God listened to Manoah’s voice; the angel of God came to the woman again as she sat in the field, but
Manoah, her husband, was not with her.
 
\s5
\v 10 So the woman hurried and ran; she recounted the event to her husband and said to him, “See, the man has appeared to me, the one who
came to me the other day.”
\v 11  Manoah rose and went after his wife; he came to the man and said to him, “Are you the man who spoke to my 
wife?” The man said, “I am.”
 
\s5
\v 12 Manoah said, “Now may your words come true. But what will be the arrangements for the child, and what must we do for him?”
\v 13 The angel of Yahweh said to Manoah, “Your wife must be careful about all the things I told her.
\v 14 She may not eat anything that comes of the grapevines, and do not let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing. See that she obeys everything that I have instructed her to do.”
\s5
\p
\v 15  Manoah said to the angel of Yahweh, “I beg you, let us delay your going a little, so that we may prepare a young goat for you.”
\v 16 The angel of Yahweh said to Manoah, “Even if you keep me here, I will not eat your food; and if you wish to make
a burnt offering, you must offer it to Yahweh.” For Manoah did not know that he was the angel of Yahweh.
 
\s5
\v 17 Manoah said to the angel of Yahweh, “What is your name, so that, when your words come true, we may honor you?”
\v 18 The angel of Yahweh said to him, “Why have you asked me name, since it is marvelous?” 
\s5
\v 19 So Manoah took the young goat with the grain offering and offered it on the rock to Yahweh: ad the angel did something marvelous, while Manoah and his wife looked on.
\v 20 For it came about, when the flame went up toward the heavens from the altar, that the angel of Yahweh ascended in the
flame of the altar. Manoah and his wife looked on and fell on their faces to the ground.
 
\s5
\p
\v 21 The angel of Yahweh appeared no more to Manoah or his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was the angel of Yahweh.
\v 22  Manoah said to his wife, “We will certainly die because we have seen God.”
 
\s5
\v 23 But his wife said to him, “If Yahweh wished to kill us, he would not have received a burnt offering or a
grain offering from our hand, neither would he have shown us all these things, nor would he have told us such things as
these at this time.”
 
\s5
\v 24 The woman bore a son and called his name Samson; the child grew, and Yahweh blessed him.
\v 25 The Spirit of Yahweh began to control him in Mahanehdan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.
 




\s5
\c 14
\p
\v 1  Samson went down to Timnah and saw a woman in Timnah, one of the daughters of the Philistines.
\v 2 He came up and told his father and his mother about her; he said, “I have seen a woman in Timnah, one of the  daughters of the
Philistines; now then, get her for me as a wife.”
 
\s5
\v 3 Then his father and his mother said to him, “Is there not at all a woman among the daughters of your brothers, or among all our people, so that you must go to take a wife from the uncircumcised Philistines?”  Samson said to his father, “Get her for me, for
she pleases me well.”
\v 4 But his father and his mother did not know that this matter came from Yahweh, for he was seeking an occasion to trouble the Philistines. Now at that time the Philistines were ruling over Israel.
 
\s5
\p
\v 5 Then Samson went down, and his father and his mother, to Timnah, and came to the vineyards of Timnah. Behold, a young lion roared against him.
\v 6 The Spirit of Yahweh came on him with power, and he tore the lion as he would have torn a young goat; he had nothing in his hand, but he did not tell his father or his mother what he had done.
 
\s5
\v 7 He went and talked with the woman, and she pleased him very much.
\v 8 After a while he returned to take her as his wife; he turned aside from his path to see the carcass of the lion, and, behold, there was a
swarm of bees and honey in the lion’s body.
\v 9 He took the honey in his hands and went on, eating as he went; he came to his father and mother and gave some to them, and they ate. But he did not tell them that he had taken the honey out of the lion’s body.
 
\s5
\p
\v 10 His father went to the woman, and Samson gave a feast there, for this is what the young men used to do.
\v 11 It came about when the young men saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him.
 
\s5
\v 12 Samson said to them, “Let me now present you a riddle to you. If you can think of the answer and tell it to me within the seven days of the feast, 
then I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothes.
\v 13 But if you cannot tell me the answer, then you will given me thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothes.” They said to him, “Present your riddle so that we may hear it.”
 
\s5
\v 14 He said to them,
\q “Out of the eater came food;
\q  Out of the strong came forth sweetness.”
\p But his guests could not find the answer in three days.
 
\s5
\p
\v 15 It came about on the seventh day that they said to Samson’s wife, “Trick your husband so that he may tell us the answer; otherwise, we will burn you and your father’s house with fire. Did you invite us here in order to make us poor?”
 
\s5
\v 16 Samson’s wife wept before him and said, “You only hate me; you do not love me. You have presented a riddle to some of my people, but you have not told me the answer.” Samson said to her, “See, I have not told it to my father or my mother; should I tell you?”
\v 17 She wept before him for all the seven days, while their feast lasted. It happened on the seventh day that he told
her the answer because she pressured him very much. Then she told the people the answer.
 
\s5
\v 18 On the seventh day before the sun went down, the men of the city said to him, “What is sweeter than honey? What is stronger than a lion?” Samson said to them,
\q “If you had not plowed with my heifer,
\q You would not have found the answer to my riddle.”
 
\s5
\p
\v 19 Then the Spirit of Yahweh came on Samson with power, and he went down to Ashkelon and struck down thirty men of its people. He took their booty, and he gave the changes of clothing to those who had answered his riddle. His anger was kindled, and he
went up to his father’s house.
\v 20 But Samson’s wife was given to his companion, whom he had treated as his friend.





\s5
\c 15
\p
\v 1 But it came about somewhat later, at the time of wheat harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a young goat; he said to himself, “I will go into my wife in her room.” But her father would not allow him to go in.
\v 2 Her father said, “I truly thought that you hated her very much, so I gave her to your companion. Her
younger sister is more beautfiul than she is, is she not? Take her, I beg you, instead of her.”
 
\s5
\v 3 Samson said to them, “This time will I be blameless in regard of the Philistines when I make trouble for them.”
\v 4 Samson went and caught three hundred foxes; then he took torches and turned the foxes tail to tail, and he tied a torch in the middle of each pair of tails.
 
\s5
\v 5 When he had set the torches on fire, he let the foxes go into the Philistines’ standing grain. The foxes burned up both the sheaves of grain and the standing grain, and also the olive orchards.
\v 6 Then the Philistines said, “Who has done this?” Others said, “Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because the Timnite took Samson’s wife and gave her to his companion.” Then the Philistines came up and burned her and her father with fire.
 
\s5
\v 7 Samson said to them, “If you act like this, I will certainly avenge myself on you, and after that I will be done.”
\v 8 Then he attacked them hip and thigh with a great slaughter; after that, he went down and lived in the opening in the rock of Etam.
 
\s5
\p
\v 9 Then the Philistines attacked and camped in Judah and spread themselves out in Lehi.
\v 10 The men of Judah said, “Why are you attacking us?” They said, “We are attacking in order to tie up Samson, to do to him as he has done to us.”
 
\s5
\v 11 Then three thousand men of Judah went down to the opening in the rock of Etam; they said to Samson, “Do you not know that
the Philistines are rulers over us? What is this, then, that you have done to us?” Samson said to them, “I did to them just as they did to me.”
.
 
\s5
\v 12 They said to Samson, “We have come down to tie you up and deliver you into the hand of the Philistines.” 
Samson said to them, “Swear to me that you will not kill me yourselves.”
\v 13 They said to him, “No; we will only tie you up well and deliver you into their hand. But we will certainly not
kill you.” Then they tied him up with two new ropes and brought him up from the rock.
 
\s5
\p
\v 14 When Samson came to Lehi, the Philistines shouted as they met him; the Spirit of Yahweh came on him with power, and
the ropes that were on his arms became like burnt flax, and his bonds dropped from his hands.
 
\s5
\v 15 Samson found a fresh jawbone of a donkey, reached out with his hand, took it, and struck down a thousand men with it.
\v 16 Samson said,
\q “With the jawbone of a donkey, heaps upon heaps;
\q With the jawbone of a donkey I have struck down a thousand men.”
 
\s5
\p
\v 17 It came about, when Samson had finished speaking, that he threw away the jawbone out of his hand; that place
came to be called Ramathlehi.
\v 18 Samson was very thirsty and called on Yahweh; he said, “You have placed this great deliverance into the hand of your servant; but now I will die of thirst and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised ones.”
 
\s5
\v 19 But God split open the hollow place that is at Lehi, and water came out. When Samson had drunk, his strength returned, and he revived; so the name of that place came to be Enhakkore, which is at Lehi to this day.
\v 20 Samson judged Israel in the days of the Philistines' domination for twenty years.




\s5
\c 16
\p
\v 1  Samson went to Gaza and saw there a prostitute; he went to sleep with her.
\v 2 This was told to the Gazites: “Samson has come here.” The Gazites surrounded him and laid in wait for him
all night at the city gate. They were quiet all night; they had said, “Let us wait until daylight, and then let us kill him.”
 
\s5
\v 3 Samson lay down until midnight; at midnight he rose and took hold of the of the city gate and its two
posts. He plucked them up, bar and all, put them on his shoulders, and carried them up to the top of the mountain that is in front of Hebron.
 
\s5
\p
\v 4 It came about afterward, that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.
\v 5 The lords of the Philistines came up to her, and said to her, “Trick him to see where his great strength
lies, and by what means we may be stronger than him, so that we may tie him up in order to made him suffer. We will give you, each one of us, eleven hundred pieces of silver.”
 
\s5
\v 6  Delilah said to Samson, “Tell me, I beg you, where your great strength lies, and how you might be bound, if someone wanted to shame you.”
\v 7 Samson said to her, “If they tie me with seven green ropes that were never dried, then I will become weak and be
like any other man.”
 
\s5
\v 8 Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to Delilah seven green ropes that had not been dried, and she tied him up with them.
\v 9 Now she had men lying in wait, staying in her inner room. She said to him, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson.” But he broke the ropes, as a candle wick is broken when it touches the fire. So the source of his strength remained unknown.
 
\s5
\p
\v 10 Delilah said to Samson, “See, you have mocked me and told me lies. Now tell me, I beg you, how you
might be tied up.”
\v 11 He said to her, “If they merely tie me up with new ropes with which no work has ever been done, I will become weak and be as any other man.”
\v 12 So Delilah took new ropes and tied him up with them. Then she said to him, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson.” The men lying in wait were in the inner room. But Samson broke the ropes off his arms like a thread.
 
 
\s5
\p
\v 13 Delilah said to Samson, “You have mocked me until now and told me lies. Tell me how you might be tied up.”
Samson said to her, “If you weave the seven locks of my head with the loom, I will be as any other man.”
\v 14 Delilah fastened his head with the pin and said to him, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson.” He woke up out of his sleep and plucked away the pin of the beam and the web.
 
\s5
\p
\v 15 She said to him, “How can you say, ‘I love you,’ when your heart is not with me? You have mocked me these three times and have not told me were your great strength lies.”
\v 16 It came about, when she pressed him daily with her words and urged him, that he was annoyed to death.
 
\s5
\v 17 So Samson told her all his heart and said to her, “No razor has evern come on my head, for I have been a Nazirite for God from my mother’s womb. If I am shaved, then my strength will go from me, and I will become weak and be like any
other man.”
 
\s5
\p
\v 18  When Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying,
“Come up this once more, for he has told me all his heart.” Then the lords of the Philistines came up to her and brought the money
in their hand.
\v 19 She made him sleep in her lap; she called for a man and shaved off the seven locks of his head. Then she
began to mock him, and his strength went from him.
 
\s5
\v 20 She said, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson.” He woke up out of his sleep and said, “I will escape like the other times and shake myself free.” But he did not know that Yahweh had departed from him.
\v 21 The Philistines laid hold of him and put out his eyes; they brought him down to Gaza and tied him with fetters
of bronze; he ground a mill in the prison house.
\v 22 However, the hair on his head began to grow again after he was shaved.
 
\s5
\p
\v 23 The lords of the Philistines gathered together to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god, and to rejoice;
for they said, “Our god has delivered Samson, our enemy, into our hand.”
\v 24 When the people saw him, they praised their god; for they said, “Our god has delivered our enemy into our hand, the destroyer of our country, who has killed many of us.”
 
\s5
\v 25 It came about, when their hearts were very happy, that they said, “Call for Samson, that he may entertain us.” They called for Samson out of the prison house; he entertained them in their presence. They set him between the pillars of the temple.
\v 26 Samson said to the lad who held him by the hand, “Allow me to touch the pillars on which the building rests, so I may lean on them.”
 
\s5
\v 27 Now the house was full of men and women; all the lords of the Philistines were there; and there were on the roof
about three thousand men and women, who looked on while Samson was entertaining them.
 
\s5
\p
\v 28  Samson called to Yahweh and said, “O Lord Yahweh, remember me, I beg you, and strengthen me, I ask you only
this once, O God, so that I may be avenged at one time one the Philistines for the loss of my two eyes.”
\v 29  Samson took hold of the two middle pillars on which the building rested and leaned on them, one pillar with his right
hand, and the other with his left.
 
\s5
\v 30  Samson said, “Let me die with the Philistines.” He bowed with all his might, and the building fell on the
lords and on all the people who were in it. So the dead whom he killed at his own death were more than those whom  he had killed in his life.
\v 31 Then his brothers and all the house of his father came down, took him, brought him back, and buried him between
Zorah and Eshtaol in the burial place of Manoah, his father. He had judged Israel for twenty years.




\s5
\c 17
\p
\v 1 In the hill country of Ephraim was a man whose name was Micah.
\v 2 He said to his mother, “The eleven hundred pieces of silver that were taken from you, over which you
invoked a curse, and said it in my ears, see, the silver is with me; I took it.” His mother said, “May my son be blessed by Yahweh!”
 
\s5
\v 3 He restored the eleven hundred pieces of silver to his mother; his mother said, “Indeed, I am dedicating this silver from my hand to Yahweh for my son, to make a carved wooden figure and a cast metal figure.” Her son said, “So now, I will restore it to you.”
\v 4 When he restored the money to his mother, his mother took two hundred pieces of silver and gave them to a metal worker, who made carved figure and a cast metal figure with it. It was placed in the house of Micah.
 
\s5
\v 5 The man Micah had a house of gods; he made an ephod and teraphim, and he consecrated one of his sons to become his priest.
\v 6 In those days there was no king in Israel; every man did what was right in his own eyes.
 
\s5
\p
\v 7 Now there was a young man of Bethlehem in Judah, of the family of Judah, who was a Levite; he stayed there temporarily.
\v 8 The man left Bethlehem in Judah to go and stay where he could find
a place; as he journeyed, he came to Micah's house in the hill country of Ephraim.
\v 9 Micah said to him, “Where have you come from?” The man said to him, “I am a Levite of Bethlehem in Judah, and I am going to stay somewhere, where I might find a place to live.”
 
 
\s5
\v 10 Micah said to him, “Live with me and be an adviser and a priest to me, and I will give you ten
pieces of silver every year and a suit of clothes, and your food.” So the Levite went in.
\v 11 The Levite was content to live with the man; and the young man was to Micah like one of his sons.
 
\s5
\v 12 Micah paid the Levite, and the young man became his priest and was in Micah’s house.
\v 13 Then Micah said, “Now know I that Yahweh will do good for me, since I have a Levite as my priest.”
 




\s5
\c 18
\p
\v 1 In those days there was no king in Israel; and in those days the tribe of the people of Dan were looking for land for their inheritance and to live in, for up to that day their inheritance had not fallen to them among the tribes of Israel.
\v 2 The people of Dan sent of their family five men from their whole number, men of courage, from Zorah and from Eshtaol,
to scout the land and to search it. They said to them, “Go search the land.” They came to the hill country of
Ephraim, to the house of Micah, and slept there.
 
\s5
\v 3 When they were at Micah’s house, they heard the voice of the young man the Levite; they turned to him and
said, “Who brought you here? What are you doing here? What business do you have here here?”
\v 4 He said to them, “Micah has treated me in such and such a way; he has hired me, and I have become his priest.”
 
\s5
\v 5 They said to him, “Ask advice, we beg you, from God, so that we might know whether our we will succeed in the way that we are going.”
\v 6 The priest said to them, “Go in peace; Yahweh is watching over the way that you are going.”
 
\s5
\p
\v 7 Then the five men departed and came to Laish, and looked at the people who were there. They say how they were living in peace, as the people of Sidon did—
for there was no one in the land that had any authority to shame them in any way; moreover, they were far from the people of Sidon, and they had no dealings with anyone else.
\v 8 They went bac to their brothers to Zorah and Eshtaol. Their brothers said to them, “What do you have to say?”
 
\s5
\v 9 They said, “Arise, let us attack them, for we have seen the land, and, see, it is very good. Are you
still hesitating? Do not hesitate to attack and possess the land.
\v 10 When you go, you will come to a people who are at peace, and the land is large; for God has given it into your hand, a place where there is no lack of anything that is in the earth.”
 
\s5
\p
\v 11 So from the family of the Danites, out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men equipped with
weapons of war went out.
\v 12 They went up and camped at Kiriathjearim, in Judah; therefore, people called that place Mahanehdan, and it is called that to this day;
behold, it is behind Kiriathjearim.
 
\s5
\v 13 They passed from there to the hill country of Ephraim and came to Micah’s house.
\p
\v 14 Then the five men who had gone to scout the country of Laish said to their brothers, “Do you know that an ephod, household gods, a carved figure, and a cast metal figure are in these houses? Now then, consider what you need to do.”
 
\s5
\v 15 They turned aside from there and went to the house of the young man, the Levite, the house of Micah, and asked the Levite about his well-being.
\v 16 The six hundred men of the people of Dan, equipped with their war weapons, stood by the opening of the
gate.
 
\s5
\v 17 The five men who had gone to scout the land went up and came in; they took the carved figure, the ephod, and the household gods, and the cast metal figure, while the priest stood by the opening of the gate with the six hundred men armed with weapons of war.
\v 18  When these went into Micah’s house and fetched the carved figure, the ephod, the household gods, and the cast metal figure, the priest said to them, “What are you doing?”
 
\s5
\v 19 They said to him, “Be quiet and lay your hand on your mouth; come with us and be father and priest for us. Is it better for you to be priest for the house of one man, or to be priest for a tribe and a family in Israel?”
\v 20 The priest’s heart was glad, and he took the ephod, the household gods, and the carved figure, and went among the people.
 
\s5
\p
\v 21 So they turned and departed; they put the little ones, the cattle, and the goods ahead of themselves.
\v 22 When they were a good way from Micah’s house, the men who were in the houses nearby gathered
together and overtook the people of Dan.
\v 23 They cried to the people of Dan. They turned around and said to Micah, “What is bothering you, that you come to us with such a group of men as this?”
 
 
\s5
\v 24 He said, “You have taken away the gods that I made and my priest; you are leaving, and what else do I own? Why do you say to me, “What is bothering you?”?
\v 25 The people of Dan said to him, “Do not let your voice be heard by us, or angry fellows might attack us, and you would lose your life, and the lives of those in your household.”
\v 26 The people of Dan went on their way; when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back to his house.
 
\s5
\p
\v 27 The people of Dan took what Micah had made, and the priest whom he had possessed, and came to Laish, to a people who were quiet and living in peace; they struck down them with the edge of the sword and burned the city with fire.
\v 28 There was no one to save them because it was far from Sidon, and the people had no dealings with anyone. It was in the valley that lies by Bethrehob. The people of Dan rebuilt the city and lived in it.
\v 29 They called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their ancestor, who was born to Israel. But the name of the city had been Laish at first.
 
\s5
\v 30 The people of Dan set up  the carved figure for themselves, and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, he
and his sons were priests for the tribe of the Danites until the day of land’s captivity.
\v 31 So they set them up Micah’s carved figure  that he made, as long as the house of God was at Shiloh.

\c 19
\p
\v 1 It came about in those days, when there was no king in Israel, that a certain Levite was staying on the
far side of the hill country of Ephraim; he had taken for himself a concubine from Bethlehem of Judah.
\v 2 His concubine acted unfaithfully toward him and went away to her father’s house in Bethlehem of Judah; she was there for four months.
 
\s5
\v 3 Her husband rose and went after her to speak kindly to her, in order to bring her back. He had his servant with him and
a couple of donkeys. She brought him into her father’s house; when girl's  father saw him, he was glad that he had come.
\v 4 His father-in-law, the girl’s father, kept him from leaving, so that he stayed there for three days. They ate and drank, and they slept there.
 
\s5
\v 5 It came about that on the fourth day they rose early in the morning, and the Levite prepared to depart. But the girl’s 
father said to his son-in-law, “Strengthen yourself with a bit of food, and afterward you may go on your journey.”
\v 6 So they sat down and ate and drink, both of them together. Then the girl’s father said to the man, “Be content, I
beg you, to wait all night before you leave; let your heart be happy.”
 
\s5
\v 7 However, the man rose up to depart, but his father-in-law urged him to stay, so he stayed there again that night.
\v 8 The Levite rose early in the morning on the fifth day to leave, but the girl’s father said, “Strengthen yourself, I beg
you, and wait until the afternoon,” so they ate, both of them.
 
\s5
\v 9 When the Levite rose up to depart, he, his concubine, and his servant, his father-in-law, the girl’s father, said
to him, “See, now the day is advancing toward evening; I pray you wait all night. See, the day grows to its end. Stay 
here so that you can enjoy yourself, and tomorrow you can go on your way early, to go home.” 
\s5
\p
\v 10 But the Levite refused to wait another night; isstead, he rose up and departed; he went near Jebus (that is, Jerusalem). With him were a couple of saddled donkeys; his concubine was also with him.
\v 11 When they were near Jebus, the daylight was far gone; the servant said to his master, “Come, I beg you, let us turn aside into this city of the Jebusites and stay in it.”
 
\s5
\v 12 His master said to him, “We will not turn aside into the city of foreigners, those who do not belong to the people of Israel; we will pass over to Gibeah.”
\v 13 He said to his servant, “Come, let us go to one of those places; we will stay in Gibeah or Ramah.”
 
\s5
\v 14 So they passed on and went on their way; the sun went down on them near Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin.
\v 15 They turned aside there to stay at Gibeah. The Levite went in and sat down in the city’s plaza, for no one took them into his house to stay.
 
\s5
\p
\v 16 Behold, an old man was coming in the evening from his work in the field. Now this man was from the hill country of Ephraim, and he was staying in Gibeah, but the men of the town were Benjamites.
\v 17 The old man raised his eyes and saw the traveler in the city plaza. The old man said, “Where are you going?
Where are you coming from?”
 
\s5
\v 18 The Levite said to him, “We are traveling from Bethlehem in Judah to the far side of the hill country of Ephraim; that is where I come from. I went to Bethlehem in Judah, and I am now going to the house of Yahweh; but there is no one who will welcome me into his house.
\v 19 However, we have both straw and feed for our donkeys; and there also is bread and wine for me, for your female servant here, and for this young man, who is one of your servants. We lack nothing.”
 
\s5
\v 20 The old man said, “May you have peace; let everything you need be my responsibility. Just do not stay in the plaza.” 
\v 21 So the old man brought the Levite into his house and gave feed to the donkeys. They washed their feet and at and drank. 
\s5
\p
\v 22 As they were having a good time behold, the men of the city, certain worthless fellows, surrounded the house and beat on the door. They spoke to the old man, the master of the house, saying, “Bring out the man who came into your house, so that we may have sex with him.”
\v 23 The man, the master of the house, went out to them and said to them, “No, my brothers, I beg you, do not such a wicked thing, since this man has come into my house. Do not do this wicked thing.
 
\s5
\v 24 See, here are my daughter, who is a virgin, and here is his concubine; I will bring out now, and you can humiliate them and do to them whatever seems good to you; but do not do any such wicked thing to this man.”
\v 25 But the men would not listen to him; so the Levite seized his concubine and brought her out to them. They raped her and abused her all night long until morning. When the day began to dawn, they let her go.
\v 26 Then at dawn the woman came and fell down at the door of the man’s house where her master was; she lay there until it was light.
 
\s5
\p
\v 27 Her master rose up in the morning and opened the doors of the house; he went out to go on his way; but, behold, the woman, his concubine, was there, fallen down at the door of the house, with her hands on the threshold.
\v 28 He said to her, “Get up; let us be going,” but she did not answered. Then he lifted her up and put her on the donkey. He rose up and went to his home.
 
\s5
\v 29 When he had come into his own house, he took a knife, laid hold of his concubine, and divided her, limb by limb, into
twelve pieces, and sent them everywhere within all the borders of Israel.
\v 30 It happened that all who saw this said, “Never has such deed been done or seen from the day that the people of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt to this present day. We must consider, plan together, and speak.”
 





\s5
\c 20
\p
\v 1 Then all the people of Israel went out, and the people assembled together, from Dan to Beersheba, with the people of Gilead also; they assembled before Yahweh at Mizpah.
\v 2 The leaders of all the people, of all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of
God, who were 400,000 men on foot who drew the sword.
 
\s5
\v 3 (Now the people of Benjamin heard that the people of Israel were gone up to Mizpah.) The people of Israel said, “Tell us, how did this wicked action happen?”
\v 4 The Levite, the husband of the woman who had been murdered, answered and said, “I came to Gibeah that belongs to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to stay there the night.
 
 
\s5
\v 5 The men of Gibeah attacked me, and surrounded the house around me by night. They were intending to kill me and rape my concubine, and now she is dead.
\v 6 I took my concubine and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel; for those people have committed this obscene act, this wickedness, in Israel.
\v 7 See, you people of Israel, all of you, give us here your advice and plans.”
 
\s5
\p
\v 8 All the people arose together and said, “None of us will go to his tent, or any of us turn back to his own house!
\v 9 Instead, this is the thing that we must do to Gibeah: we will attack it by throwing lots.
 
\s5
\v 10 We will take ten men of one hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and one hundred of one thousand, and one thousand
out of ten thousand, to bring food for these people. We will do that so that, when they arrive at Gibeah of Benjamin, they may pay them for the wickedness that they have committed in Israel.”
\v 11 So all the men of Israel gathered against the city, joined together like one man.
 
\s5
\p
\v 12 The tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, “What is this wickedness that has happened among you?
\v 13 Now then, deliver up the men, the worthless fellows, who are in Gibeah, so that we may put them to death, and burn away this evil from Israel.” But Benjamin would not listen to the voice of their brothers, the people of Israel.
\v 14 The people of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities to Gibeah, to go out to battle against the
people of Israel.
 
\s5
\v 15 The people of Benjamin coming from their cities on that day numbered twenty-six thousand men who drew the sword, besides the inhabitants of Gibeah, who numbered seven hundred chosen men.
\v 16 Among all these people there were seven hundred chosen left-handed men; each of them could sling stones at something no wider than a hair and not miss. 
\s5
\p
\v 17 The men of Israel, apart from Benjamin, numbered 400,000 men who drew the sword; all of these were men able to fight.
\v 18 The people of Israel arose, went up to Bethel, and asked for advice from God; they said, “Who first will attack for us the people of Benjamin?”  Yahweh said, “Judah will attack first.”
 
\s5
\p
\v 19 The people of Israel rose up in the morning and camped facing Gibeah.
\v 20 The men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; the men of Israel arranged their battle lines against them at
Gibeah.
\v 21 The men of Benjamin came out of Gibeah, and struck down to the ground on that day twenty-two thousand men of the Israelites.
 
\s5
\v 22-23 The people of Israel went up and wept before Yahweh until the evening; they asked Yahweh, saying, “Should we go into battle again against the people of Benjamin our brother?” 
\p Yahweh said, “Go attack him again.” The people, the men of Israel, encouraged themselves and again arranged their battle lines in the same place where they drawn up for battle on the first day.

\s5
\p
\v 24 So the people of Israel went against the people of Benjamin the second day.
\v 25 Benjamin went out against them from Gibeah on the second day; they struck down to the ground eighteen thousand men of the people of Israel, all of whom drew the sword.
 
\s5
\v 26 Then all the people of Israel, all the people, went up to Bethel and wept. They sat there before
Yahweh and fasted that day until the evening; they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings to Yahweh.
 
\s5
\v 27 The people of Israel asked Yahweh—for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days,
\v 28 and Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, was serving before it in those days—they said, “Should we still go out to battle against the people of Benjamin our brother, or should we stop?” Yahweh said, “Attack, for I will deliver him into your hand tomorrow.”
 
\s5
\p
\v 29 So Israel set men in ambush around Gibeah.
\v 30 The people of Israel went up against the people of Benjamin on the third day and set themselves in battle lines against Gibeah, as at the other times.
 
\s5
\v 31 The people of Benjamin went out against the people, and they were drawn away from the city. They began to strike and kill some of the men, about thirty men of Israel, who fell on the roads, one of which goes up to Bethel, and the other to Gibeah, and in the fields.
 
\s5
\v 32 The people of Benjamin said, “They are struck down before us, just as at first.” But the people of Israel said, “Let us run back and draw them away from the city to the roads.”
\v 33 So all the men of Israel rose up out of their places and set themselves in their battle lines at Baaltamar. Then the men waiting in ambush ran out from their place, out of Maarehgibeah.
 
\s5
\v 34 Ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel attacked Gibeah. Now the battle was severe, but the Benjamites were unaware that disaster was near.
\v 35 Yahweh struck down Benjamin before Israel; the people of Israel killed 25,100 men of Benjamin on that day, all men who drew the sword.
 
\s5
\p
\v 36 So the people of Benjamin saw that they were defeated; the men of Israel had given ground to Benjamin, because they were counting on the men whom they had placed in ambush against Gibeah.
\v 37 Then the men in ambush hurried and rushed into Gibeah; they hurried in and struck down all the city’s inhabitants with the edge of the sword.
\v 38 Now the arranged signal between the men of Israel and the men in ambush had been that they should make a large column of smoke rise up out of the city.
 
\s5
\v 39 So the men of Israel turned in the battle to fight, and Benjamin struck down and killed about thirty men of Israel. The Benjamites said, “Surely they are defeated before us, as in the first battle.”
 
\s5
\v 40 But when a cloud of smoke began to rise up out of the city as a pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind; and, behold, the entire city was going up in smoke to the heavens.
\v 41 Then the men of Israel turned, and the men of Benjamin were alarmed, for they saw that disaster had come on them.
 
\s5
\v 42 So they turned their backs to the men of Israel to take the road to the wilderness; but the fighting followed closely behind them. The men of Israel who came out of the cities killed them in their midst.
 
\s5
\v 43 They surrounded the Benjamites and chased them; and trampled them as they tried to rest, near Gibeah on the eastern side.
\v 44 Eighteen thousand men of Benjamin fell in battle; all these were men of courage.
 
\s5
\v 45 They turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon. Even so, the Israelites killed five thousand stragglers on the roads. They closely pursued them to Gidom and struck down two thousand more.
\v 46 The result was that all the men of Benjamin who fell that day were twenty-five thousand, who drew the sword; all of these were men of courage.
 
\s5
\v 47 But six hundred men turned and fled toward the wilderness, to the rock of Rimmon; they stayed at the rock of Rimmon for four months.
\v 48 The men of Israel turned back against the people of Benjamin and struck down them with the edge of the sword—the entire city, the cattle, and everything that they found. In addition, they set on fire all the cities they came to. 




\s5
\c 21
\p
\v 1 Now the men of Israel had sworn at Mizpah, saying, “None of us will any daughter to Benjamin as a wife.”
\v 2 Then the people went to Bethel and sat there before God until the evening; they raised their voices and wept loudly.
\v 3 They said, “O Yahweh, God of Israel, why has this happened to Israel, that one tribe should be missing today?”
 
\s5
\v 4 It came about on the next day that the people rose early and built an altar there; they offered burnt offerings and
fellowship offerings.
\v 5 The people of Israel said, “Who is there among all the tribes of Israel who did not come up in the assembly to
Yahweh?” For they had made a strong oath concerning anyone who did not come up to Yahweh to Mizpah; they said, “He must certainly be put to death.”
 
\s5
\v 6 The people of Israel were sorry about their brother Benjamin; they said, “One tribe has been cut off from Israel today.
\v 7 How will we obtain wives for those who remain alive, since we have sworn by Yahweh that we will not give them any of our daughters as wives?”
 
\s5
\p
\v 8 They said, “Who is there of the tribes of Israel who did not come up to Yahweh at Mizpah?” Behold, no one came from Jabeshgilead to the assembly.
\v 9 For when the people were counted, behold, none of the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead were there.
\v 10 The assembly sent twelve thousand men of the most courageous among them; they commanded them, saying, “Go strike down the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the children.
 
\s5
\v 11 This is what you must do: you must kill every male and every woman who has slept with a man.”
\v 12 The men found among the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead four hundred young virgins, who had not known man by lying with him; they brought them to the camp to Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.
 
\s5
\p
\v 13 The whole congregation sent and spoke to the people of Benjamin who were at the rock of Rimmon; they assured them there would be peace.
\v 14 So Benjamin returned at that time; the Israelites gave them the women whom they had saved alive from the women of Jabeshgilead, but there were not enough women for them.
\v 15 The people were sorry for Benjamin, because Yahweh had put division among the tribes of Israel.
 
\s5
\p
\v 16 Then the leaders of the assembly said, “How will arrange for wives for the Benjamites who remain, since the women of Benjamin are killed?”
\v 17 They said, “There must be an inheritance for those of Benjamin who have survived, so that a tribe is not blotted out from Israel.
 
\s5
\v 18 However, we must not give them wives from our own daughters!” For the people of Israel had sworn, saying, “Cursed be anyone who gives a wife to Benjamin.”
\v 19 They said, “See, there is a feast for Yahweh from year to year at Shiloh, which is to the north of Bethel, on the
east side of the road that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and to the south of Lebonah.”
 
\s5
\v 20 They instructed the men of Benjamin, saying, “Go and lie in wait in the vineyards.
\v 21 Watch and see when girls of Shiloh come out to dance, then you should go out of the vineyards, and each one of you should catch a wife from the girls of Shiloh, and go back to the land of Benjamin.
 
\s5
\v 22 It will happen that when their fathers or their brothers come to complain to us, we will say to them, ‘Please give your daughters to us, because we did not find wives for them during the war. Also, you did not actually give your daughters to them, so you are not guilty.”
\s5
\v 23 The people of Benjamin did so; they took the number of wives that they needed from the girls who danced, and they carried them off. They went and returned to their inheritance, rebuilt their cities, and lived in them.
\v 24 The people of Israel departed from there at that time, each man to his own tribe and family; each of them went back from there to his own inheritance.
 
\s5
\p
\v 25 In those days there was no king in Israel; every man did what was right in his own eyes.
