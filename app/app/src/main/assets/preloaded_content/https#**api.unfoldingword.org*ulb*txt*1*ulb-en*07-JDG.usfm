So Simeon went with him.\s5\v 4 And Judah went up; and Jehovah delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand: and they struck of them in Bezek ten thousand men.\v 5 And they found Adoni-bezek in Bezek; and they fought against him, and they struck the Canaanites and the Perizzites.\s5\v 6 But Adoni-bezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.\v 7 And Adoni-bezek said, Threescore and ten kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered their food under my table: as I have done, so God has requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.\s5\p\v 8 And the children of Judah fought against Jerusalem, and took it, and struck it with the edge of the sword, and set the cityon fire.\v 9 And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites that lived in the hill-country, and in theSouth, and in the lowland.\v 10 And Judah went against the Canaanites that lived in Hebron (now the name of Hebron beforetime was Kiriath-arba); and theystruck Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.\s5\p\v 11 And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir. (Now the name of Debir beforetime was Kiriath-sepher.)\v 12 And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kiriath-sepher, and takes it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.\v 13 And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Calebâs younger brother, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.\s5\v 14 And it came to pass, when she came to him, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she alightedfrom off her ass; and Caleb said to her, What would thou?\v 15 And she said to him, Give me a blessing; for that you have set me in the land of the South, give me also springs ofwater. And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the nether springs.\s5\p\v 16 And the children of the Kenite, Mosesâ brother-in-law, went up out of the city of palm-trees with the children of Judahinto the wilderness of Judah, which is in the south of Arad; and they went and lived with the people.\v 17 And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they struck the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it.And the name of the city was called Hormah.\s5\v 18 Also Judah took Gaza with the border thereof, and Ashkelon with the border thereof, and Ekron with the border thereof.\v 19 And Jehovah was with Judah; and drove out the inhabitants ofthe hill-country; for he could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.\s5\v 20 And they gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses had spoken: and he drove out thence the three sons of Anak.\v 21 And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with thechildren of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.\s5\p\v 22 And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Beth-el; and Jehovah was with them.\v 23 And the house of Joseph sent to spy out Beth-el. (Now the name of the city beforetime was Luz.)\v 24 And the watchers saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said to him, Show us, we pray thee, the entrance intothe city, and we will deal kindly with thee.\s5\v 25 And he showed them the entrance into the city; and they struck the city with the edge of the sword; but they let the mango and all his family.\v 26 And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called the name thereof Luz, which is the namethereof to this day.\s5\p\v 27 And Manasseh did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shean and its towns, norof Taanach and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and its towns, northe inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.\v 28 And it came to pass, when Israel was waxed strong, that they put the Canaanites to taskwork, and did not utterly drivethem out.\s5\p\v 29 And Ephraim drove not out the Canaanites that lived in Gezer; but the Canaanites lived in Gezer among them.\s5\p\v 30 Zebulun drove not out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites lived among them, andbecame subject to taskwork.\s5\p\v 31 Asher drove not out the inhabitants of Acco, nor the inhabitants of Sidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah,nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob;\v 32 but the Asherites lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land; for they did not drive them out.\s5\p\v 33 Naphtali drove not out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh, nor the inhabitants of Beth-anath; but he lived among theCanaanites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and of Beth-anath became subject totaskwork.\s5\p\v 34 And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the hill-country; for they would not suffer them to come down to thevalley;\v 35 but the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres, in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed,so that they became subject to taskwork.\v 36 And the border of the Amorites was from the ascent of Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward.\s5\c 2\p\v 1 And the angel of Jehovah came up from Gilgal to Bochim. And he said, I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have broughtyou to the land which I sware to your fathers; and I said, I will never break my covenant with you:\v 2 and you shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land; you shall break down their altars. But you have notlistened to my voice: why have you done this?\s5\v 3 Wherefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall beas thorns in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare to you.\v 4 And it came to pass, when the angel of Jehovah spoke these words to all the children of Israel, that the people liftedup their voice, and wept.\v 5 And they called the name of that place Bochim: and they sacrificed there to Jehovah.\s5\p\v 6 Now when Joshua had sent the people away, the children of Israel went every man to his inheritance to possess the land.\v 7 And the people served Jehovah all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seenall the great work of Jehovah that he had wrought for Israel.\v 8 And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Jehovah, died, being a hundred and ten years old.\s5\v 9 And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-heres, in the hill-country of Ephraim, on the north of themountain of Gaash.\v 10 And also all that generation were gathered to their fathers: and there arose another generation after them, that knewnot Jehovah, nor yet the work which he had wrought for Israel.\s5\p\v 11 And the children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and served the Baalim;\v 12 and they forsook Jehovah, the God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods,of the gods of the peoples that were round about them, and bowed themselves down to them: and they provoked Jehovah to anger.\v 13 And they forsook Jehovah, and served Baal and the Ashtaroth.\s5\v 14 And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that despoiledthem; and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about, so that they could not any longer stand before theirenemies.\v 15 Whithersoever they went out, the hand of Jehovah was against them for evil, as Jehovah had spoken, and as Jehovah hadsworn to them: and they were sore distressed.\s5\p\v 16 And Jehovah raised up judges, who saved them out of the hand of those that despoiled them.\v 17 And yet they listened not to their judges; for they played the harlot after other gods, and bowed themselves down tothem: they turned aside quickly out of the way wherein their fathers walked, obeying the commandments of Jehovah;but they did not so.\s5\v 18 And when Jehovah raised them up judges, then Jehovah was with the judge, and saved them out of the hand of their enemiesall the days of the judge: for it repented Jehovah because of their groaning by reason of them that oppressed them and vexedthem.\v 19 But it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they turned back, and dealt more corruptly than their fathers, infollowing other gods to serve them, and to bow down to them; they ceased not from their doings, nor from their stubborn way.\s5\v 20 And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel; and he said, Because this nation have transgressed my covenant whichI commanded their fathers, and have not listened to my voice;\v 21 I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations that Joshua left when he died;\v 22 that by them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep the way of Jehovah to walk therein, as their fathers did keep it,or not.\v 23 So Jehovah left those nations, without driving them out hastily; neither delivered he them into the hand of Joshua.\s5\c 3\p\v 1 Now these are the nations which Jehovah left, to prove Israel by them, even as manyof Israel as had not known all the wars of Canaan;\v 2 only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as beforetime knewnothing thereof:\v 3 namely, the five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites thatlived in mount Lebanon, from mount Baal-hermon to the entrance of Hamath.\s5\v 4 And they were left, to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would listen to the commandments ofJehovah, which he commanded their fathers by Moses.\v 5 And the children of Israel lived among the Canaanites, the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and theHivites, and the Jebusites:\v 6 and they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their own daughters to their sons and served their gods.\s5\p\v 7 And the children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and forgat Jehovah their God, and served theBaalim and the Asheroth.\v 8 Therefore the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Cushan-rishathaim king ofMesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Cushan-rishathaim eight years.\s5\v 9 And when the children of Israel cried to Jehovah, Jehovah raised up a savior to the children of Israel, who saved them,even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Calebâs younger brother.\v 10 And the Spirit of Jehovah came upon him, and he judged Israel; and he went out to war, and Jehovah deliveredCushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand: and his hand prevailed against Cushan-rishathaim.\v 11 And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.\s5\p\v 12 And the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah: and Jehovah strengthened Eglon the kingof Moab against Israel, because they had done that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah.\v 13 And he gathered to him the children of Ammon and Amalek; and he went and struck Israel, and they possessed the city ofpalm-trees.\v 14 And the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.\s5\p\v 15 But when the children of Israel cried to Jehovah, Jehovah raised them up a saviour, Ehud the son of Gera, theBenjamite, a man left-handed. And the children of Israel sent tribute by him to Eglon the king of Moab.\s5\v 16 And Ehud made him a sword which had two edges, a cubit in length; and he girded it under his raiment upon his rightthigh.\v 17 And he offered the tribute to Eglon king of Moab: now Eglon was a very fat man.\v 18 And when he had made an end of offering the tribute, he sent away the people that bare the tribute.\s5\v 19 But he himself turned back from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand to thee, O king. Andhe said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.\v 20 And Ehud came to him; and he was sitting by himself alone in the cool upper room. And Ehud said, I have a message fromGod to thee. And he arose out of his seat.\s5\v 21 And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into his body:\v 22 and the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, for he drew not the sword out of his body;and it came out behind.\v 23 Then Ehud went forth into the porch, and shut the doors of the upper room upon him, and locked them.\s5\p\v 24 Now when he was gone out, his servants came; and they saw, and, behold, the doors of the upper room were locked; and theysaid, Surely he is covering his feet in the upper chamber.\v 25 And they tarried till they were ashamed; and, behold, he opened not the doors of the upper room: therefore they took thekey, and opened them; and, behold, their lord was fallen down dead on the earth.\s5\p\v 26 And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped to Seirah.\v 27 And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the hill-country of Ephraim; and the children of Israelwent down with him from the hill-country, and he before them.\s5\v 28 And he said to them, Follow after me; for Jehovah has delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And theywent down after him, and took the fords of the Jordan against the Moabites, and suffered not a man to pass over.\v 29 And they struck of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, every lusty man, and every man of valor; and there escapednot a man.\v 30 So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest fourscore years.\s5\p\v 31 And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who struck of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox-goad: and he alsosaved Israel.\s5\c 4\p\v 1 And the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, when Ehud was dead.\v 2 And Jehovah sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, that reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host was Sisera,who lived in Harosheth of the Gentiles.\v 3 And the children of Israel cried to Jehovah: for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightilyoppressed the children of Israel.\s5\p\v 4 Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, she judged Israel at that time.\v 5 And she lived under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Beth-el in the hill-country of Ephraim: and the children ofIsrael came up to her for judgment.\s5\v 6 And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedesh-naphtali, and said to him, Hath not Jehovah, the God ofIsrael, commanded, saying, Go and draw to mount Tabor, and take with you ten thousand men of the children ofNaphtali and of the children of Zebulun?\v 7 And I will draw to thee, to the river Kishon, Sisera, the captain of Jabinâs army, with his chariots and his multitude;and I will deliver him into your hand.\s5\v 8 And Barak said to her, If you will go with me, then I will go; but if you will not go with me, I will not go.\v 9 And she said, I will surely go with thee: notwithstanding, the journey that you take shall not be for your honor; forJehovah will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.\s5\v 10 And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali together to Kedesh; and there went up ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborahwent up with him.\s5\p\v 11 Now Heber the Kenite had separated himself from the Kenites, even from the children of Hobab the brother-in-law of Moses,and had pitched his tent as far as the oak in Zaanannim, which is by Kedesh.\s5\p\v 12 And they told Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to mount Tabor.\v 13 And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that were with him,from Harosheth of the Gentiles, to the river Kishon.\s5\v 14 And Deborah said to Barak, Up; for this is the day in which Jehovah has delivered Sisera into your hand; is not Jehovahgone out before thee? So Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.\s5\v 15 And Jehovah discomfited Sisera, and all his chariots, and all his host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; andSisera alighted from his chariot, and fled away on his feet.\v 16 But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, to Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fellby the edge of the sword; there was not a man left.\s5\p\v 17 Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite; for there was peace between Jabinthe king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.\v 18 And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said to him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And he turned in to herinto the tent, and she covered him with a rug.\s5\v 19 And he said to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink; for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk,and gave him drink, and covered him.\v 20 And he said to her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be, when any man does come and inquire of thee, andsay, Is there any man here? that you shall say, No.\s5\v 21 Then Jael Heberâs wife took a tent-pin, and took a hammer in her hand, and went softly to him, and struck the pin intohis temples, and it pierced through into the ground; for he was in a deep sleep; so he swooned and died.\v 22 And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said to him, Come, and I will show you the manwhom you seekest. And he came to her; and, behold, Sisera lay dead, and the tent-pin was in his temples.\s5\p\v 23 So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel.\v 24 And the hand of the children of Israel prevailed more and more against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyedJabin king of Canaan.\s5\c 5\p\v 1 Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day, saying,\q\v 2 For that the leaders took the lead in Israel,\q For that the people offered themselves willingly,\q Bless you Jehovah.\s5\q\v 3 Hear, O you kings; give ear, O you princes;\q I, even I, will sing to Jehovah;\q I will sing praise to Jehovah, the God of Israel.\q\v 4 Jehovah, when you went forth out of Seir,\q When you marchedst out of the field of Edom,\q The earth trembled, the heavens also dropped,\q Yea, the clouds dropped water.\s5\q\v 5 The mountains quaked at the presence of Jehovah,\q Even yon Sinai at the presence of Jehovah, the God of Israel.\b\q\v 6 In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath,\q In the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied,\q And the travellers walked through byways.\s5\q\v 7 The rulers ceased in Israel, they ceased,\q Until that I Deborah arose,\q That I arose a mother in Israel.\q\v 8 They chose new gods;\q Then was war in the gates:\q Was there a shield or spear seen\q Among forty thousand in Israel?\s5\q\v 9 My heart is toward the governors of Israel,\q That offered themselves willingly among the people:\q Bless you Jehovah.\q\v 10 Tell of it, you that ride on white asses,\q You that sit on rich carpets,\q And you that walk by the way.\s5\q\v 11 Far from the noise of archers, in the places of drawing water,\q There shall they rehearse the righteous acts of Jehovah,\q Even the righteous acts of his rule in Israel.\q Then the people of Jehovah went down to the gates.\b\s5\q\v 12 Awake, awake, Deborah;\q Awake, awake, utter a song:\q Arise, Barak, and lead away your captives, you son of Abinoam.\q\v 13 Then came down a remnant of the nobles and the people;\q Jehovah came down for me against the mighty.\s5\q\v 14 Out of Ephraim came down they whose root is in Amalek;\q After thee, Benjamin, among your peoples;\q Out of Machir came down governors,\q And out of Zebulun they that handle the marshalâs staff.\s5\q\v 15 And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah;\q As was Issachar, so was Barak;\q Into the valley they rushed forth at his feet.\q By the watercourses of Reuben\q There were great resolves of heart.\s5\q\v 16 Why sattest you among the sheepfolds,\q To hear the pipings for the flocks?\q At the watercourses of Reuben\q There were great searchings of heart.\s5\q\v 17 Gilead abode beyond the Jordan:\q And Dan, why did he remain in ships?\q Asher sat still at the haven of the sea,\q And abode by his creeks.\q\v 18 Zebulun was a people that jeoparded their lives to the death,\q And Naphtali, upon the high places of the field.\b\s5\q\v 19 The kings came and fought;\q Then fought the kings of Canaan,\q In Taanach by the waters of Megiddo:\q They took no gain of money.\q\v 20 From heaven fought the stars,\q From their courses they fought against Sisera.\s5\q\v 21 The river Kishon swept them away,\q That ancient river, the river Kishon.\q O my soul, march on with strength.\q\v 22 Then did the horsehoofs stamp\q By reason of the prancings, the prancings of their strong ones.\s5\q\v 23 Curse you Meroz, said the angel of Jehovah.\q Curse you bitterly the inhabitants thereof,\q Because they came not to the help of Jehovah,\q To the help of Jehovah against the mighty.\b\s5\q\v 24 Blessed above women shall Jael be,\q The wife of Heber the Kenite;\q Blessed shall she be above women in the tent.\q\v 25 He asked water, and she gave him milk;\q She brought him butter in a lordly dish.\s5\q\v 26 She put her hand to the tent-pin,\q And her right hand to the workmenâs hammer;\q And with the hammer she struck Sisera, she struck through his head;\q Yea, she pierced and struck through his temples.\q\v 27 At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay;\q At her feet he bowed, he fell:\q Where he bowed, there he fell down dead.\b\s5\q\v 28 Through the window she looked forth, and cried,\q The mother of Sisera cried through the lattice,\q Why is his chariot so long in coming?\q Why wait the wheels of his chariots?\s5\q\v 29 Her wise ladies answered her,\q Yea, she returned answer to herself,\q\v 30 Have they not found, have they not divided the spoil?\q A damsel, two damsels to every man;\q To Sisera a spoil of dyed garments,\q A spoil of dyed garments embroidered,\q Of dyed garments embroidered on both sides, on the necks of the spoil?\s5\q\v 31 So let all your enemies perish, O Jehovah:\q But let them that love him be as the sun when he goes forth in his might.\p And the land had rest forty years.\s5\c 6\p\v 1 And the children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah: and Jehovah delivered them into the hand ofMidian seven years.\v 2 And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel; and because of Midian the children of Israel made them the dens which arein the mountains, and the caves, and the strongholds.\s5\v 3 And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east; theycame up against them;\v 4 and they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of the earth, till you come to Gaza, and left no sustenancein Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass.\s5\v 5 For they came up with their cattle and their tents; they came in as locusts for multitude; both they and their camels werewithout number: and they came into the land to destroy it.\v 6 And Israel was brought very low because of Midian; and the children of Israel cried to Jehovah.\s5\p\v 7 And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried to Jehovah because of Midian,\v 8 that Jehovah sent a prophet to the children of Israel: and he said to them, Thus says Jehovah, the God of Israel, Ibrought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth out of the house of bondage;\s5\v 9 and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all that oppressed you, and drove them outfrom before you, and gave you their land;\v 10 and I said to you, I am Jehovah your God; you shall not fear the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell. But youhave not listened to my voice.\s5\p\v 11 And the angel of Jehovah came, and sat under the oak which was in Ophrah, that pertained to Joash the Abiezrite: andhis son Gideon was beating out wheat in the winepress, to hide it from the Midianites.\v 12 And the angel of Jehovah appeared to him, and said to him, Jehovah is with thee, you mighty man of valor.\s5\v 13 And Gideon said to him, Oh, my lord, if Jehovah is with us, why then is all this befallen us? and where are all his wondrous works which our fathers told us of, saying, Did not Jehovah bring us up from Egypt? but now Jehovah has cast us off, and delivered us into the hand of Midian.\s5\v 14 And Jehovah looked upon him, and said, Go in this your might, and save Israel from the hand of Midian: have not I sent thee?\v 15 And he said to him, Oh, Lord, wherewith shall I save Israel? behold, my family is the poorest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my fatherâs house.\s5\v 16 And Jehovah said to him, Surely I will be with thee, and you shall strike the Midianites as one man.\v 17 And he said to him, If now I have found favor in your sight, then show me a sign that it is you that talkest with me.\v 18 Depart not hence, I pray thee, until I come to thee, and bring forth my present, and lay it before thee. And he said, I will wait until you come again.\s5\p\v 19 And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of an ephah of meal: the flesh he put in a basket, and heput the broth in a pot, and brought it out to him under the oak, and presented it.\v 20 And the angel of God said to him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and pour outthe broth. And he did so.\s5\v 21 Then the angel of Jehovah put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavenedcakes; and there went up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and the angel of Jehovahdeparted out of his sight.\s5\v 22 And Gideon saw that he was the angel of Jehovah; and Gideon said, Alas, O Lord Jehovah! forasmuch as I have seen theangel of Jehovah face to face.\v 23 And Jehovah said to him, Peace be to thee; fear not: you shall not die.\v 24 Then Gideon built an altar there to Jehovah, and called it Jehovah-shalom: to this day it is yet in Ophrah of theAbiezrites.\s5\p\v 25 And it came to pass the same night, that Jehovah said to him, Take your fatherâs bullock, even the second bullock sevenyears old, and throw down the altar of Baal that your father hath, and cut down the Asherah that is by it;\v 26 and build an altar to Jehovah your God upon the top of this stronghold, in the orderly manner, and take the secondbullock, and offer a burnt offering with the wood of the Asherah which you shall cut down.\s5\v 27 Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as Jehovah had spoken to him: and it came to pass, because he fearedhis fatherâs household and the men of the city, so that he could not do it by day, that he did it by night.\s5\p\v 28 And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was broken down, and the Asherah wascut down that was by it, and the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was built.\v 29 And they said one to another, Who has done this thing? And when they inquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son ofJoash has done this thing.\s5\v 30 Then the men of the city said to Joash, Bring out your son, that he may die, because he has broken down the altar of Baal, and because he has cut down the Asherah that was by it.\s5\v 31 And Joash said to all that stood against him, Will you contend for Baal? Or will you save him? he that will contend for him, let him be put to death while it is yet morning: if he be a god, let him contend for himself, because one has broken down his altar.\v 32 Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal contend against him, because he has broken down his altar.\s5\p\v 33 Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east assembled themselves together; and they passed over, and encamped in the valley of Jezreel.\s5\v 34 But the Spirit of Jehovah came upon Gideon; and he blew a trumpet; and Abiezer was gathered together after him.\v 35 And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; and they also were gathered together after him: and he sent messengersto Asher, and to Zebulun, and to Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.\s5\p\v 36 And Gideon said to God, If you will save Israel by my hand, as you have spoken,\v 37 behold, I will put a fleece of wool on the threshing-floor; if there be dew on the fleece only, and it be dry upon all the ground, then shall I know that you will save Israel by my hand, as you have spoken.\s5\v 38 And it was so; for he rose up early on the morrow, and pressed the fleece together, and wrung the dew out of the fleece, a bowlful of water.\s5\v 39 And Gideon said to God, Let not your anger be kindled against me, and I will speak but this once: let me make trial, Ipray thee, but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew.\v 40 And God did so that night: for it was dry upon the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground.\s5\c 7\p\v 1 Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people that were with him, rose up early, and encamped beside the spring of Harod: and the camp of Midian was on the north side of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.\s5\p\v 2 And Jehovah said to Gideon, The people that are with you are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hand, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand has saved me.\v 3 Now therefore proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whosoever is fearful and trembling, let him return and depart from mount Gilead. And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand; and there remained ten thousand.\s5\p\v 4 And Jehovah said to Gideon, The people are yet too many; bring them down to the water, and I will try them for you there: and it shall be, that of whom I say to thee, This shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee; and of whoever I say to thee, This shall not go with thee, the same shall not go.\s5\v 5 So he brought down the people to the water: and Jehovah said to Gideon, Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue, as a dog lappeth, him shall you set by himself; likewise every one that bows down upon his knees to drink.\v 6 And the number of them that lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, was three hundred men: but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water.\s5\v 7 And Jehovah said to Gideon, By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into your hand; and let all the people go every man to his place.\v 8 So the people took food in their hand, and their trumpets; and he sent all the men of Israel every man to his tent,but retained the three hundred men: and the camp of Midian was beneath him in the valley.\s5\p\v 9 And it came to pass the same night, that Jehovah said to him, Arise, get you down into the camp; for I have delivered it into your hand.\v 10 But if you fear to go down, go you with Purah your servant down to the camp:\v 11 and you shall hear what they say; and afterward shall your hands be strengthened to go down into the camp. Then went he down with Purah his servant to the outermost part of the armed men that were in the camp.\s5\v 12 And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like locusts formultitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand which is upon the sea-shore for multitude.\s5\v 13 And when Gideon was come, behold, there was a man telling a dream to his fellow; and he said, Behold, I dreamed a dream; and, lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the camp of Midian, and came to the tent, and struck it so that it fell, and turned it upside down, so that the tent lay flat.\v 14 And his fellow answered and said, This is nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: into his hand God has delivered Midian, and all the host.\s5\p\v 15 And it was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and the interpretation thereof, that he worshipped; and he returned into the camp of Israel, and said, Arise; for Jehovah has delivered into your hand the host of Midian.\v 16 And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put into the hands of all of them trumpets, and empty pitchers, with torches within the pitchers.\s5\v 17 And he said to them, Look on me, and do likewise: and, behold, when I come to the outermost part of the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so shall you do.\v 18 When I blow the trumpet, I and all that are with me, then blow you the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and say, For Jehovah and for Gideon.\s5\p\v 19 So Gideon, and the hundred men that were with him, came to the outermost part of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch, when they had but newly set the watch: and they blew the trumpets, and brake in pieces the pitchers that were in their hands.\s5\v 20 And the three companies blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers, and held the torches in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right hands wherewith to blow; and they cried, The sword of Jehovah and of Gideon.\v 21 And they stood every man in his place round about the camp; and all the host ran; and they shouted, and putthem to flight.\s5\v 22 And they blew the three hundred trumpets, and Jehovah set every manâs sword against his fellow, and against all the host; and the host fled as far as Beth-shittah toward Zererah, as far as the border of Abel-meholah, by Tabbath.\v 23 And the men of Israel were gathered together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after Midian.\s5\p\v 24 And Gideon sent messengers throughout all the hill-country of Ephraim, saying, Come down against Midian, and take before them the waters, as far as Beth-barah, even the Jordan. So all the men of Ephraim were gathered together, and took the waters as far as Beth-barah, even the Jordan.\v 25 And they took the two princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb; and they killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb they killed at the winepress of Zeeb, and pursued Midian: and they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon beyond the Jordan.\s5\c 8\p\v 1 And the men of Ephraim said to him, Why have you served us thus, that you calledst us not, when you went to fightwith Midian? And they did chide with him sharply.\s5\v 2 And he said to them, What have I now done in comparison with you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim betterthan the vintage of Abiezer?\v 3 God has delivered into your hand the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb: and what was I able to do in comparison with you?Then their anger was abated toward him, when he had said that.\s5\p\v 4 And Gideon came to the Jordan, and passed over, he, and the three hundred men that were with him, faint, yetpursuing.\v 5 And he said to the men of Succoth, Give, I pray you, loaves of bread to the people that follow me; for they are faint,and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian.\s5\v 6 And the princes of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand, that we should give bread to yourarmy?\v 7 And Gideon said, Therefore when Jehovah has delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, then I will tear your flesh withthe thorns of the wilderness and with briers.\s5\v 8 And he went up thence to Penuel, and spoke to them in like manner; and the men of Penuel answered him as the men ofSuccoth had answered.\v 9 And he spoke also to the men of Penuel, saying, When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower.\s5\p\v 10 Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their hosts with them, about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of allthe host of the children of the east; for there fell a hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword.\s5\v 11 And Gideon went up by the way of them that lived in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and struck the host; for thehost was secure.\v 12 And Zebah and Zalmunna fled; and he pursued after them; and he took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, anddiscomfited all the host.\s5\p\v 13 And Gideon the son of Joash returned from the battle from the ascent of Heres.\v 14 And he caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and inquired of him: and he described for him the princes of Succoth,and the elders thereof, seventy and seven men.\s5\v 15 And he came to the men of Succoth, and said, Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, concerning whom you did taunt me, saying, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand, that we should give bread to your men that are weary?\v 16 And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth.\v 17 And he brake down the tower of Penuel, and killed the men of the city.\s5\p\v 18 Then said he to Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men were they whom you killed at Tabor? And they answered, As you art, so were they; each one resembled the children of a king.\v 19 And he said, They were my brethren, the sons of my mother: as Jehovah liveth, if you had saved them alive, I would notkill you.\s5\v 20 And he said to Jether his first-born, Up, and kill them. But the youth drew not his sword; for he feared, because hewas yet a youth.\v 21 Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise thou, and fall upon us; for as the man is, so is his strength. And Gideon arose, andkilled Zebah and Zalmunna, and took the crescents that were on their camelsâ necks.\s5\p\v 22 Then the men of Israel said to Gideon, Rule you over us, both you, and your son, and your sonâs son also; for you havesaved us out of the hand of Midian.\v 23 And Gideon said to them, I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you: Jehovah shall rule over you.\s5\v 24 And Gideon said to them, I would make a request of you, that you would give me every man the ear-rings of his spoil.(For they had golden ear-rings, because they were Ishmaelites.)\v 25 And they answered, We will willingly give them. And they spread a garment, and did cast therein every man the ear-ringsof his spoil.\s5\v 26 And the weight of the golden ear-rings that he requested was a thousand and seven hundredshekels of gold; besides the crescents, and the pendants, and the purple raiment that was on the kings of Midian, andbesides the chains that were about their camelsâ necks.\s5\v 27 And Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city, even in Ophrah: and all Israel played the harlot after itthere; and it became a snare to Gideon, and to his house.\v 28 So Midian was subdued before the children of Israel, and they lifted up their heads no more. And the land had rest fortyyears in the days of Gideon.\s5\p\v 29 And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and lived in his own house.\v 30 And Gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten; for he had many wives.\v 31 And his concubine that was in Shechem, she also bare him a son, and he called his name Abimelech.\s5\v 32 And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was buried in the sepulchre of Joash his father, in Ophrah of theAbiezrites.\p\v 33 And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of Israel turned again, and played the harlot afterthe Baalim, and made Baal-berith their god.\s5\v 34 And the children of Israel remembered not Jehovah their God, who had delivered them out of the hand of all their enemieson every side;\v 35 neither showed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had showed to Israel.\s5\c 9\p\v 1 And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem to his motherâs brethren, and spoke with them, and with all thefamily of the house of his motherâs father, saying,\v 2 Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the men of Shechem, Whether is better for you, that all the sons of Jerubbaal, whoare threescore and ten persons, rule over you, or that one rule over you? remember also that I am your bone and your flesh.\s5\v 3 And his motherâs brethren spoke of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words: and their hearts inclined tofollow Abimelech; for they said, He is our brother.\v 4 And they gave him threescore and ten pieces of silver out of the house of Baal-berith, wherewith Abimelech hiredvain and light fellows, who followed him.\s5\v 5 And he went to his fatherâs house at Ophrah, and killed his brethren the sons of Jerubbaal, being threescore and tenpersons, upon one stone: but Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left; for he hid himself.\v 6 And all the men of Shechem assembled themselves together, and all the house of Millo, and went and made Abimelech king, by the oak of the pillar that was in Shechem.\s5\p\v 7 And when they told it to Jotham, he went and stood on the top of mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and cried, andsaid to them, Listen to me, you men of Shechem, that God may listen to you.\v 8 The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them; and they said to the olive-tree, Reign you over us.\s5\v 9 But the olive-tree said to them, Should I leave my fatness, wherewith by me they honor God and man, and go to wave toand fro over the trees?\v 10 And the trees said to the fig-tree, Come thou, and reign over us.\v 11 But the fig tree said to them, Should I leave my sweetness, and my good fruit, and go to wave to and fro over thetrees?\s5\v 12 And the trees said to the vine, Come thou, and reign over us.\v 13 And the vine said to them, Should I leave my new wine, which cheers God and man, and go to wave to and fro over thetrees?\v 14 Then said all the trees to the bramble, Come thou, and reign over us.\s5\v 15 And the bramble said to the trees, If in truth you anoint me king over you, then come and take refuge in my shade; andif not, let fire come out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon.\v 16 Now therefore, if you have dealt truly and uprightly, in that you have made Abimelech king, and if you have dealt well withJerubbaal and his house, and have done to him according to the deserving of his hands\s5\v 17 (for my father fought for you, and adventured his life, and delivered you out of the hand of Midian:\v 18 and you are risen up against my fatherâs house this day, and have slain his sons, threescore and ten persons, upon onestone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his maid-servant, king over the men of Shechem, because he is your brother);\s5\v 19 if you then have dealt truly and uprightly with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, then rejoice you in Abimelech, andlet him also rejoice in you:\v 20 but if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the men of Shechem, and the house of Millo; and let fire comeout from the men of Shechem, and from the house of Millo, and devour Abimelech.\v 21 And Jotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and lived there, for fear of Abimelech his brother.\s5\p\v 22 And Abimelech was prince over Israel three years.\v 23 And God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously withAbimelech:\v 24 that the violence done to the threescore and ten sons of Jerubbaal might come, and that their blood might be laid uponAbimelech their brother, who killed them, and upon the men of Shechem, who strengthened his hands to kill his brethren.\s5\v 25 And the men of Shechem set liers-in-wait for him on the tops of the mountains, and they robbed all that came along thatway by them: and it was told Abimelech.\s5\p\v 26 And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren, and went over to Shechem; and the men of Shechem put their trust in him.\v 27 And they went out into the field, and gathered their vineyards, and trodthe grapes, and held festival, and went into the house of their god, and did eat and drink, and cursed Abimelech.\s5\v 28 And Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? is not he the son ofJerubbaal? and Zebul his officer? serve you the men of Hamor the father of Shechem: but why should we serve him?\v 29 And would that this people were under my hand! then would I remove Abimelech. And he said to Abimelech, Increase yourarmy, and come out.\s5\p\v 30 And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled.\v 31 And he sent messengers to Abimelech craftily, saying, Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his brethren are come toShechem; and, behold, they constrain the city to take part against thee.\s5\v 32 Now therefore, up by night, you and the people that are with thee, and lie in wait in the field:\v 33 and it shall be, that in the morning, as soon as the sun is up, you shall rise early, and rush upon the city; and,behold, when he and the people that are with him come out against thee, then may you do to them as you shall findoccasion.\s5\p\v 34 And Abimelech rose up, and all the people that were with him, by night, and they laid wait against Shechem in fourcompanies.\v 35 And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city: and Abimelech rose up, and thepeople that were with him, from the ambushment.\s5\v 36 And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there come people down from the tops of the mountains. And Zebulsaid to him, You see the shadow of the mountains as if they were men.\v 37 And Gaal spoke again and said, See, there come people down by the middle of the land, and one company comes by the wayof the oak of Meonenim.\s5\v 38 Then said Zebul to him, Where is now your mouth, that you saidst, Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him? is notthis the people that you have despised? go out now, I pray, and fight with them.\v 39 And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech.\v 40 And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and there fell many wounded, even to the entrance of the gate.\s5\p\v 41 And Abimelech lived at Arumah: and Zebul drove out Gaal and his brethren, that they should not dwell in Shechem.\v 42 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people went out into the field; and they told Abimelech.\v 43 And he took the people, and divided them into three companies, and laid wait in the field; and he looked, and, behold,the people came forth out of the city; and he rose up against them, and struck them.\s5\v 44 And Abimelech, and the companies that were with him, rushed forward, and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city:and the two companies rushed upon all that were in the field, and struck them.\v 45 And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took the city, and killed the people that were therein: and hebeat down the city, and sowed it with salt.\s5\p\v 46 And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard thereof, they entered into the stronghold of the house of El-berith.\v 47 And it was told Abimelech that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together.\s5\v 48 And Abimelech got him up to mount Zalmon, he and all the people that were with him; and Abimelech took an axe in hishand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it up, and laid it on his shoulder: and he said to the people that werewith him, What you have seen me do, make haste, and do as I have done.\v 49 And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put them to the stronghold, and setthe stronghold on fire upon them; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women.\s5\p\v 50 Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took it.\v 51 But there was a strong tower within the city, and there fled all the men and women, and all they of the city, and shutthemselves in, and got them up to the roof of the tower.\s5\v 52 And Abimelech came to the tower, and fought against it, and drew near to the door of the tower to burn it with fire.\v 53 And a certain woman cast an upper millstone upon Abimelechâs head, and brake his skull.\v 54 Then he called hastily to the young man his armorbearer, and said to him, Draw your sword, and kill me, that men saynot of me, A woman killed him. And his young man thrust him through, and he died.\s5\v 55 And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed every man to his place.\v 56 Thus God requited the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did to his father, in slaying his seventy brethren;\v 57 and all the wickedness of the men of Shechem did God requite upon their heads: and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.\s5\c 10\p\v 1 And after Abimelech there arose to save Israel Tola the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he lived inShamir in the hill-country of Ephraim.\v 2 And he judged Israel twenty and three years, and died, and was buried in Shamir.\s5\p\v 3 And after him arose Jair, the Gileadite; and he judged Israel twenty and two years.\v 4 And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and they had thirty cities, which are called Havvoth-jair to thisday, which are in the land of Gilead.\v 5 And Jair died, and was buried in Kamon.\s5\p\v 6 And the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and served the Baalim, and theAshtaroth, and the gods of Syria, and the gods of Sidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the children of Ammon, and thegods of the Philistines; and they forsook Jehovah, and served him not.\v 7 And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of the Philistines, and into the handof the children of Ammon.\s5\v 8 And they vexed and oppressed the children of Israel that year: eighteen yearsoppressed they all the children of Israel that were beyond the Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is inGilead.\v 9 And the children of Ammon passed over the Jordan to fight also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the houseof Ephraim; so that Israel was sore distressed.\s5\p\v 10 And the children of Israel cried to Jehovah, saying, We have sinned against thee, even because we have forsaken ourGod, and have served the Baalim.\v 11 And Jehovah said to the children of Israel, Did not I save you from the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines?\v 12 The Sidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites, did oppress you; and you cried to me, and I saved you out oftheir hand.\s5\v 13 Yet you have forsaken me, and served other gods: wherefore I will save you no more.\v 14 Go and cry to the gods which you have chosen; let them save you in the time of your distress.\s5\v 15 And the children of Israel said to Jehovah, We have sinned: do you to us whatever seems good to thee; onlydeliver us, we pray thee, this day.\v 16 And they put away the foreign gods from among them, and served Jehovah; and his soul was grieved for the misery ofIsrael.\s5\p\v 17 Then the children of Ammon were gathered together, and encamped in Gilead. And the children of Israel assembledthemselves together, and encamped in Mizpah.\v 18 And the people, the princes of Gilead, said one to another, What man is he that will begin to fight against the childrenof Ammon? he shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.\s5\c 11\p\v 1 Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valor, and he was the son of a harlot: and Gilead became the father of Jephthah.\v 2 And Gileadâs wife bare him sons; and when his wifeâs sons grew up, they drove out Jephthah, and said to him, You shallnot inherit in our fatherâs house; for you are the son of another woman.\v 3 Then Jephthah fled from his brethren, and lived in the land of Tob: and there were gathered vain fellows to Jephthah, andthey went out with him.\s5\p\v 4 And it came to pass after a while, that the children of Ammon made war against Israel.\v 5 And it was so, that, when the children of Ammon made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah outof the land of Tob;\v 6 and they said to Jephthah, Come and be our chief, that we may fight with the children of Ammon.\s5\v 7 And Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, Did not you hate me, and drive me out of my fatherâs house? and why are youcome to me now when you are in distress?\v 8 And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, Therefore are we turned again to you now, that you may go with us, andfight with the children of Ammon; and you shall be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.\s5\v 9 And Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, If you bring me home again to fight with the children of Ammon, and Jehovahdeliver them before me, shall I be your head?\v 10 And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, Jehovah shall be witness between us; surely according to your word so will wedo.\v 11 Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and chief over them: and Jephthah spoke allhis words before Jehovah in Mizpah.\s5\p\v 12 And Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the children of Ammon, saying, What have you to do with me, that you arecome to me to fight against my land?\v 13 And the king of the children of Ammon answered to the messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel took away my land, when hecame up out of Egypt, from the Arnon even to the Jabbok, and to the Jordan: now therefore restore thoselands again peaceably.\s5\v 14 And Jephthah sent messengers again to the king of the children of Ammon;\v 15 and he said to him, Thus says Jephthah: Israel took not away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon;\v 16 but when they came up from Egypt, and Israel went through the wilderness to the Red Sea, and came to Kadesh;\s5\v 17 then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, Let me, I pray thee, pass through your land; but the king ofEdom listened not. And in like manner he sent to the king of Moab; but he would not: and Israel abode in Kadesh.\v 18 Then they went through the wilderness, and went around the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east sideof the land of Moab, and they encamped on the other side of the Arnon; but they came not within the border of Moab, for theArnon was the border of Moab.\s5\v 19 And Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and Israel said to him, Let us pass,we pray thee, through your land to my place.\v 20 But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his border; but Sihon gathered all his people together, and encamped inJahaz, and fought against Israel.\s5\v 21 And Jehovah, the God of Israel, delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they struck them: soIsrael possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country.\v 22 And they possessed all the border of the Amorites, from the Arnon even to the Jabbok, and from the wilderness even tothe Jordan.\s5\v 23 So now Jehovah, the God of Israel, has dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel, and should youpossess them?\v 24 Wilt not you possess that which Chemosh your god gives you to possess? So whoever Jehovah our God has dispossessedfrom before us, them will we possess.\v 25 And now are you anything better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? did he ever strive against Israel, or did heever fight against them?\s5\v 26 While Israel lived in Heshbon and its towns, and in Aroer and its towns, and in all the cities that are along by the sideof the Arnon, three hundred youars; wherefore did you not recover them within that time?\v 27 I therefore have not sinned against thee, but you do me wrong to war against me: Jehovah, the Judge, be judge thisday between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon.\v 28 Howbeit the king of the children of Ammon listened not to the words of Jephthah which he sent him.\s5\p\v 29 Then the Spirit of Jehovah came upon Jephthah, and he passed over Gilead and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead,and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over to the children of Ammon.\v 30 And Jephthah vowed a vow to Jehovah, and said, If you will indeed deliver the children of Ammon into my hand,\v 31 then it shall be, that whatever comes forth from the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from thechildren of Ammon, it shall be Jehovahâs, and I will offer it up for a burnt-offering.\s5\v 32 So Jephthah passed over to the children of Ammon to fight against them; and Jehovah delivered them into his hand.\v 33 And he struck them from Aroer until you come to Minnith, even twenty cities, and to Abelcheramim, with a very greatslaughter. So the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel.\s5\p\v 34 And Jephthah came to Mizpah to his house; and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances:and she was his only child; besides her he had neither son nor daughter.\v 35 And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he tore his clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! you have brought me verylow, and you are one of them that trouble me; for I have opened my mouth to Jehovah, and I cannot go back.\s5\v 36 And she said to him, My father, you have opened your mouth to Jehovah; do to me according to that which hasproceeded out of your mouth, forasmuch as Jehovah has taken vengeance for you on your enemies, even on the children of Ammon.\v 37 And she said to her father, Let this thing be done for me: let me alone two months, that I may depart and go down uponthe mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my companions.\s5\v 38 And he said, Go. And he sent her away for two months: and she departed, she and her companions, and bewailed hervirginity upon the mountains.\v 39 And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned to her father, who did with her according to his vowwhich he had vowed: and she knew not man. And it was a custom in Israel,\v 40 that the daughters of Israel went yearly to celebrate the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year.\s5\c 12\p\v 1 And the men of Ephraim were gathered together, and passed northward; and they said to Jephthah, Wherefore passedst youover to fight against the children of Ammon, and did not call us to go with you? we will burn your house upon you with fire.\v 2 And Jephthah said to them, I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, yousaved me not out of their hand.\s5\v 3 And when I saw that you saved me not, I put my life in my hand, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and Jehovah delivered them into my hand: wherefore then are you come up to me this day, to fight against me?\v 4 Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim; and the men of Gilead struck Ephraim,because they said, You are fugitives of Ephraim, you Gileadites, in the midst of Ephraim, and in the midst of Manasseh.\s5\v 5 And the Gileadites took the fords of the Jordan against the Ephraimites. And it was so, that, whenany of the fugitives of Ephraim said, Let me go over, the men of Gilead said to him, Are you an Ephraimite? If he said, Nay;\v 6 then said they to him, Say now Shibboleth; and he said Sibboleth; for he could not frame to pronounce it right: thenthey laid hold on him, and killed him at the fords of the Jordan. And there fell at that time of Ephraim forty and two thousand.\s5\p\v 7 And Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then died Jephthah the Gileadite, and was buried in one of the cities of Gilead.\s5\p\v 8 And after him Ibzan of Beth-lehem judged Israel.\v 9 And he had thirty sons; and thirty daughters he sent abroad, and thirty daughters he brought in from abroad for his sons.And he judged Israel seven years.\s5\v 10 And Ibzan died, and was buried at Beth-lehem.\v 11 And after him Elon the Zebulunite judged Israel; and he judged Israel ten years.\v 12 And Elon the Zebulunite died, and was buried in Aijalon in the land of Zebulun.\s5\p\v 13 And after him Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite judged Israel.\v 14 And he had forty sons and thirty sonsâ sons, that rode on threescore and ten ass colts: and he judged Israel eight years.\v 15 And Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died, and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the hill-countryof the Amalekites.\s5\c 13\p\v 1 And the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah; and Jehovah delivered them into the handof the Philistines forty years.\p\v 2 And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, andbare not.\s5\v 3 And the angel of Jehovah appeared to the woman, and said to her, Behold now, you are barren, and bear not; butyou shall conceive, and bear a son.\v 4 Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink no wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing:\v 5 for, lo, you shall conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come upon his head; for the child shall be a Naziriteto God from the womb: and he shall begin to save Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.\s5\v 6 Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came to me, and his countenance was like the countenance of the angel of God, very terrible; and I asked him not whence he was, neither told he me his name:\v 7 but he said to me, Behold, you shall conceive, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, and eat not anyunclean thing; for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb to the day of his death.\s5\p\v 8 Then Manoah entreated Jehovah, and said, Oh, Lord, I pray thee, let the man of God whom you did send come again tous, and teach us what we shall do to the child that shall be born.\v 9 And God listened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came again to the woman as she sat in the field: butManoah her husband was not with her.\s5\v 10 And the woman made haste, and ran, and told her husband, and said to him, Behold, the man has appeared to me, thatcame to me the other day.\v 11 And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said to him, Are you the man that spoke to thewoman? And he said, I am.\s5\v 12 And Manoah said, Now let your words come to pass: what shall be the ordering of the child, and how shall we do to him?\v 13 And the angel of Jehovah said to Manoah, Of all that I said to the woman let her beware.\v 14 She may not eat of anything that comes of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing; all that I commanded her let her observe.\s5\p\v 15 And Manoah said to the angel of Jehovah, I pray thee, let us detain thee, that we may make ready a kid for thee.\v 16 And the angel of Jehovah said to Manoah, Though you detain me, I will not eat of your bread; and if you will makeready a burnt-offering, you must offer it to Jehovah. For Manoah knew not that he was the angel of Jehovah.\s5\v 17 And Manoah said to the angel of Jehovah, What is your name, that, when your words come to pass, we may do you honor?\v 18 And the angel of Jehovah said to him, Wherefore asked you after my name, seeing it is wonderful?\s5\v 19 So Manoah took the kid with the grain offering, and offered it upon the rock to Jehovah: and the angel did wondrously, and Manoah and his wife looked on.\v 20 For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar, that the angel of Jehovah ascended in theflame of the altar: and Manoah and his wife looked on; and they fell on their faces to the ground.\s5\p\v 21 But the angel of Jehovah did no more appear to Manoah or to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was the angel of Jehovah.\v 22 And Manoah said to his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God.\s5\v 23 But his wife said to him, If Jehovah were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt offering and agrain offering at our hand, neither would he have showed us all these things, nor would at this time have told such things asthese.\s5\v 24 And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the child grew, and Jehovah blessed him.\v 25 And the Spirit of Jehovah began to move him in Mahaneh-dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.\s5\c 14\p\v 1 And Samson went down to Timnah, and saw a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines.\v 2 And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, I have seen a woman in Timnah of the daughters of thePhilistines: now therefore get her for me to wife.\s5\v 3 Then his father and his mother said to him, Is there never a woman among the daughters of your brethren, or among all mypeople, that you go to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines? And Samson said to his father, Get her for me; forshe pleases me well.\v 4 But his father and his mother knew not that it was of Jehovah; for he sought an occasion against the Philistines. Now atthat time the Philistines had rule over Israel.\s5\p\v 5 Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnah, and came to the vineyards of Timnah: and, behold, a young lion roared against him.\v 6 And the Spirit of Jehovah came mightily upon him, and he tore him as he would have tore a kid; and he had nothing in hishand: but he told not his father or his mother what he had done.\s5\v 7 And he went down, and talked with the woman, and she pleased Samson well.\v 8 And after a while he returned to take her; and he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion: and, behold, there was aswarm of bees in the body of the lion, and honey.\v 9 And he took it into his hands, and went on, eating as he went; and he came to his father and mother, and gave to them,and they did eat: but he told them not that he had taken the honey out of the body of the lion.\s5\p\v 10 And his father went down to the woman: and Samson made there a feast; for so used the young men to do.\v 11 And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him.\s5\v 12 And Samson said to them, Let me now put forth a riddle to you: if you can declare it to me within the seven days ofthe feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty changes of raiment;\v 13 but if you cannot declare it to me, then shall you give me thirty linen garments and thirty changes of raiment. And theysaid to him, Put forth your riddle, that we may hear it.\s5\v 14 And he said to them,\q Out of the eater came forth food,\q And out of the strong came forth sweetness.\p And they could not in three days declare the riddle.\s5\p\v 15 And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said to Samsonâs wife, Entice your husband, that he may declare tous the riddle, lest we burn you and your fatherâs house with fire: have you called us to impoverish us? is it not so?\s5\v 16 And Samsonâs wife wept before him, and said, You do but hate me, and love me not: you have put forth a riddle tothe children of my people, and have not told it me. And he said to her, Behold, I have not told it my father nor my mother,and shall I tell thee?\v 17 And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted: and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he toldher, because she pressed him sore; and she told the riddle to the children of her people.\s5\v 18 And the men of the city said to him on the seventh day before the sun went down, What is sweeter than honey? and whatis stronger than a lion? And he said to them,\q If you had not plowed with my heifer,\q You had not found out my riddle.\s5\p\v 19 And the Spirit of Jehovah came mightily upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon, and struck thirty men of them, and tooktheir spoil, and gave the changes of raiment to them that declared the riddle. And his anger was kindled, and hewent up to his fatherâs house.\v 20 But Samsonâs wife was given to his companion, whom he had used as his friend.\s5\c 15\p\v 1 But it came to pass after a while, in the time of wheat harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said, Iwill go in to my wife into the chamber. But her father would not suffer him to go in.\v 2 And her father said, I verily yought that you had utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to your companion: is not heryounger sister fairer than she? take her, I pray thee, instead of her.\s5\v 3 And Samson said to them, This time shall I be blameless in regard of the Philistines, when I do them a mischief.\v 4 And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took firebrands, and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in themidst between every two tails.\s5\v 5 And when he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into the standing grain of the Philistines, and burnt up both theshocks and the standing grain, and also the oliveyards.\v 6 Then the Philistines said, Who has done this? And they said, Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he has takenhis wife, and given her to his companion. And the Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire.\s5\v 7 And Samson said to them, If you do after this manner, surely I will be avenged of you, and after that I will cease.\v 8 And he struck them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and he went down and lived in the cleft of the rock of Etam.\s5\p\v 9 Then the Philistines went up, and encamped in Judah, and spread themselves in Lehi.\v 10 And the men of Judah said, Why are you come up against us? And they said, To bind Samson are we come up, to do to him as he has done to us.\s5\v 11 Then three yousand men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam, and said to Samson, Know you not thatthe Philistines are rulers over us? what then is this that you have done to us? And he said to them, As they did to me,so have I done to them.\s5\v 12 And they said to him, We are come down to bind you, that we may deliver you into the hand of the Philistines. AndSamson said to them, Swear to me, that you will not fall upon me yourselves.\v 13 And they spoke to him, saying, No; but we will bind you fast, and deliver you into their hand: but surely we will notkill thee. And they bound him with two new ropes, and brought him up from the rock.\s5\p\v 14 When he came to Lehi, the Philistines shouted as they met him: and the Spirit of Jehovah came mightily upon him, andthe ropes that were upon his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire, and his bands dropped from off his hands.\s5\v 15 And he found a fresh jawbone of an ass, and put forth his hand, and took it, and struck a thousand men therewith.\v 16 And Samson said,\q With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps,\q With the jawbone of an ass have I struck a thousand men.\s5\p\v 17 And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking, that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand; and that placewas called Ramath-lehi.\v 18 And he was sore athirst, and called on Jehovah, and said, You have given this great deliverance by the hand of yourservant; and now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised.\s5\v 19 But God clave the hollow place that is in Lehi, and there came water thereout; and when he had drunk, his spirit cameagain, and he revived: wherefore the name thereof was called En-hakkore, which is in Lehi, to this day.\v 20 And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years.\s5\c 16\p\v 1 And Samson went to Gaza, and saw there a harlot, and went in to her.\v 2 And it was told the Gazites, saying, Samson is come hither. And they compassed him in, and laid wait for himall night in the gate of the city, and were quiet all the night, saying,Let be till morning light, then we will kill him.\s5\v 3 And Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and laid hold of the doors of the gate of the city, and the twoposts, and plucked them up, bar and all, and put them upon his shoulders, and carried them up to the top of the mountain thatis before Hebron.\s5\p\v 4 And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.\v 5 And the lords of the Philistines came up to her, and said to her, Entice him, and see wherein his great strengthlieth, and by what means we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him: and we will give you every one of useleven hundred pieces of silver.\s5\v 6 And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein your great strength lieth, and wherewith you might be boundto afflict thee.\v 7 And Samson said to her, If they bind me with seven green withes that were never dried, then shall I become weak, and beas another man.\s5\v 8 Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green withes which had not been dried, and she bound him withthem.\v 9 Now she had liers-in-wait living in the inner chamber. And she said to him, The Philistines are upon thee, Samson. Andhe brake the withes, as a string of tow is broken when it touches the fire. So his strength was not known.\s5\p\v 10 And Delilah said to Samson, Behold, you have mocked me, and told me lies: now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith youmight be bound.\v 11 And he said to her, If they only bind me with new ropes wherewith no work has been done, then shall I become weak, andbe as another man.\v 12 So Delilah took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and said to him, The Philistines are upon thee, Samson. And theliers-in-wait were living in the inner chamber. And he brake them off his arms like a thread.\s5\p\v 13 And Delilah said to Samson, Hitherto you have mocked me, and told me lies: tell me wherewith you might be bound.And he said to her, If you weavest the seven locks of my head with the web.\v 14 And she fastened it with the pin, and said to him, The Philistines are upon thee, Samson. And he awaked out of hissleep, and plucked away the pin of the beam, and the web.\s5\p\v 15 And she said to him, How can you say, I love thee, when your heart is not with me? you have mocked me these threetimes, and have not told me wherein your great strength lieth.\v 16 And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her words, and urged him, that his soul was vexed to death.\s5\v 17 And he told her all his heart, and said to her, There has not come a razor upon my head; for I have been a Naziriteto God from my motherâs womb: if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak, and be like anyother man.\s5\p\v 18 And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying,Come up this once, for he has told me all his heart. Then the lords of the Philistines came up to her, and brought the moneyin their hand.\v 19 And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a man, and shaved off the seven locks of his head; and shebegan to afflict him, and his strength went from him.\s5\v 20 And she said, The Philistines are upon thee, Samson. And he awoke out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at othertimes, and shake myself free. But he knew not that Jehovah was departed from him.\v 21 And the Philistines laid hold on him, and put out his eyes; and they brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fettersof brass; and he did grind in the prison-house.\v 22 Howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven.\s5\p\v 23 And the lords of the Philistines gathered them together to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god, and to rejoice;for they said, Our god has delivered Samson our enemy into our hand.\v 24 And when the people saw him, they praised their god; for they said, Our god has delivered into our hand our enemy, andthe destroyer of our country, who has slain many of us.\s5\v 25 And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said, Call for Samson, that he may make us sport. And theycalled for Samson out of the prison-house; and he made sport before them. And they set him between the pillars:\v 26 and Samson said to the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the houseresteth, that I may lean upon them.\s5\v 27 Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of the Philistines were there; and there were upon the roofabout three thousand men and women, that [*]saw while Samson made sport.\s5\p\v 28 And Samson called to Jehovah, and said, O Lord Jehovah, remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, onlythis once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes.\v 29 And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house rested, and leaned upon them, the one with his righthand, and the other with his left.\s5\v 30 And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed himself with all his might; and the house fell upon thelords, and upon all the people that were therein. So the dead that he killed at his death were more than they that he killed in hislife.\v 31 Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down, and took him, and brought him up, and buried him betweenZorah and Eshtaol in the burying-place of Manoah his father. And he judged Israel twenty years.\s5\c 17\p\v 1 And there was a man of the hill-country of Ephraim, whose name was Micah.\v 2 And he said to his mother, The eleven hundred pieces of silver that were taken from thee, about which youdid utter a curse, and did also speak it in mine ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it. And his mother said,Blessed be my son of Jehovah.\s5\v 3 And he restored the eleven hundred pieces of silver to his mother; and his mother said, I verily dedicate thesilver to Jehovah from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten image: now therefore I will restore it tothee.\v 4 And when he restored the money to his mother, his mother took two hundredpieces of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made thereof a graven image and a molten image: and it was in thehouse of Micah.\s5\v 5 And the man Micah had a house of gods, and he made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.\v 6 In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes.\s5\p\v 7 And there was a young man out of Beth-lehem-judah, of the family of Judah, who was a Levite; and he sojourned there.\v 8 And the man departed out of the city, out of Beth-lehem-judah, to sojourn where he could finda place, and he came to the hill-country of Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed.\v 9 And Micah said to him, Whence come thou? And he said to him, I am a Levite of Beth-lehem-judah, and I go to sojournwhere I may find a place.\s5\v 10 And Micah said to him, Dwell with me, and be to me a father and a priest, and I will give you tenpieces of silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and your victuals. So the Levite went in.\v 11 And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was to him as one of his sons.\s5\v 12 And Micah consecrated the Levite, and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah.\v 13 Then said Micah, Now know I that Jehovah will do me good, seeing I have a Levite to my priest.\s5\c 18\p\v 1 In those days there was no king in Israel: and in those days the tribe of the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwellin; for to that day their inheritance had not fallen to them among the tribes of Israel.\v 2 And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their whole number, men of valor, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol,to spy out the land, and to search it; and they said to them, Go, search the land. And they came to the hill-country ofEphraim, to the house of Micah, and lodged there.\s5\v 3 When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the young man the Levite; and they turned aside thither, andsaid to him, Who brought you hither? and what do you in this place? and what have you here?\v 4 And he said to them, Thus and thus has Micah dealt with me, and he has hired me, and I am become his priest.\s5\v 5 And they said to him, Ask counsel, we pray thee, of God, that we may know whether our way which we go shall beprosperous.\v 6 And the priest said to them, Go in peace: before Jehovah is your way wherein you go.\s5\p\v 7 Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people that were therein, how they lived in security, after themanner of the Sidonians, quiet and secure; for there was none in the land, possessing authority, that might putthem to shame in anything, and they were far from the Sidonians, and had no dealings with any man.\v 8 And they came to their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol: and their brethren said to them, Whatsay ye?\s5\v 9 And they said, Arise, and let us go up against them; for we have seen the land, and, behold, it is very good: and are youstill? be not slothful to go and to enter in to possess the land.\v 10 When you go, you shall come to a people secure, and the land is large; for God has given it into your hand, a placewhere there is no lack of anything that is in the earth.\s5\p\v 11 And there set forth from thence of the family of the Danites, out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men wrapped withweapons of war.\v 12 And they went up, and encamped in Kiriath-jearim, in Judah: wherefore they called that place Mahaneh-dan, to this day;behold, it is behind Kiriath-jearim.\s5\v 13 And they passed thence to the hill-country of Ephraim, and came to the house of Micah.\p\v 14 Then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of Laish, and said to their brethren, Do you know that thereis in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image, and a molten image? now therefore consider what you have to do.\s5\v 15 And they turned aside thither, and came to the house of the young man the Levite, even to the house of Micah, and askedhim of his welfare.\v 16 And the six hundred men wrapped with their weapons of war, who were of the children of Dan, stood by the entrance of thegate.\s5\v 17 And the five men that went to spy out the land went up, and came in thither, and took the graven image, and the ephod,and the teraphim, and the molten image: and the priest stood by the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men wrapped withweapons of war.\v 18 And when these went into Micahâs house, and fetched the graven image, the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image,the priest said to them, What do ye?\s5\v 19 And they said to him, Hold your peace, lay your hand upon your mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest:is it better for you to be priest to the house of one man, or to be priest to a tribe and a family in Israel?\v 20 And the priestâs heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the midst ofthe people.\s5\p\v 21 So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the cattle and the goods before them.\v 22 When they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men that were in the houses near to Micahâs house were gatheredtogether, and overtook the children of Dan.\v 23 And they cried to the children of Dan. And they turned their faces, and said to Micah, What aileth thee, that youcome with such a company?\s5\v 24 And he said, you have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and are gone away, and what have I more? and howthen say you to me, What aileth thee?\v 25 And the children of Dan said to him, Let not your voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows fall upon you, and youlose your life, with the lives of your household.\v 26 And the children of Dan went their way: and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went backto his house.\s5\p\v 27 And they took that which Micah had made, and the priest whom he had, and came to Laish, to a people quiet and secure,and struck them with the edge of the sword; and they burnt the city with fire.\v 28 And there was no deliverer, because it was far from Sidon, and they had no dealings with any man; and it was in thevalley that lies by Beth-rehob. And they built the city, and lived therein.\v 29 And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born to Israel: howbeit the nameof the city was Laish at the first.\s5\v 30 And the children of Dan set up for themselves the graven image; and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, heand his sons were priests to the tribe of the Danites until the day of the captivity of the land.\v 31 So they set them up Micahâs graven image which he made, all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.\s5\c 19\p\v 1 And it came to pass in those days, when there was no king in Israel, that there was a certain Levite sojourning on thefarther side of the hill-country of Ephraim, who took to him a concubine out of Beth-lehem-judah.\v 2 And his concubine played the harlot against him, and went away from him to her fatherâs house to Beth-lehem-judah, andwas there the space of four months.\s5\v 3 And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak kindly to her, to bring her again, having his servant with him, anda couple of asses: and she brought him into her fatherâs house; and when the father of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced to meethim.\v 4 And his father-in-law, the damselâs father, retained him; and he abode with him three days: so they did eat and drink, andlodged there.\s5\v 5 And it came to pass on the fourth day, that they arose early in the morning, and he rose up to depart: and the damselâsfather said to his son-in-law, Strengthen your heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward you shall go your way.\v 6 So they sat down, and did eat and drink, both of them together: and the damselâs father said to the man, Be pleased, Ipray thee, to wait all night, and let your heart be merry.\s5\v 7 And the man rose up to depart; but his father-in-law urged him, and he lodged there again.\v 8 And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart; and the damselâs father said, Strengthen your heart, I praythee, and wait you until the day declineth; and they did eat, both of them.\s5\v 9 And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and his servant, his father-in-law, the damselâs father, saidto him, Behold, now the day draweth toward evening, I pray you wait all night: behold, the day grows to an end, lodgehere, that your heart may be merry; and to-morrow get you early on your way, that you may go home.\s5\p\v 10 But the man would not wait that night, but he rose up and departed, and came over against Jebus (the same is Jerusalem):and there were with him a couple of asses saddled; his concubine also was with him.\v 11 When they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the servant said to his master, Come, I pray thee, and let us turnaside into this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.\s5\v 12 And his master said to him, We will not turn aside into the city of a foreigner, that is not of the children of Israel;but we will pass over to Gibeah.\v 13 And he said to his servant, Come and let us draw near to one of these places; and we will lodge in Gibeah, or in Ramah.\s5\v 14 So they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down upon them near to Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin.\v 15 And they turned aside thither, to go in to lodge in Gibeah: and he went in, and sat him down in the street of the city;for there was no man that took them into his house to lodge.\s5\p\v 16 And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the field at even: now the man was of the hill-country ofEphraim, and he sojourned in Gibeah; but the men of the place were Benjamites.\v 17 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the wayfaring man in the street of the city; and the old man said, Whither go thou?and whence come thou?\s5\v 18 And he said to him, We are passing from Beth-lehem-judah to the farther side of the hill-country of Ephraim; fromthence am I, and I went to Beth-lehem-judah: and I am now going to the house of Jehovah; and there is no man thattakes me into his house.\v 19 Yet there is both straw and provender for our asses; and there is bread and wine also for me, and for your handmaid, andfor the young man that is with your servants: there is no lack of anything.\s5\v 20 And the old man said, Peace be to thee; howsoever let all your wants lie upon me; only lodge not in the street.\v 21 So he brought him into his house, and gave the asses fodder; and they washed their feet, and did eat and drink.\s5\p\v 22 As they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain base fellows, beset the house round about,beating at the door; and they spoke to the master of the house, the old man, saying, Bring forth the man that came into yourhouse, that we may know him.\v 23 And the man, the master of the house, went out to them, and said to them, Nay, my brethren, I pray you, do not sowickedly; seeing that this man is come into my house, do not this folly.\s5\v 24 Behold, here is my daughter a virgin, and his concubine; them I will bring out now, and humble you them, and do with themwhat seems good to you: but to this man do not any such folly.\v 25 But the men would not listen to him: so the man laid hold on his concubine, and brought her forth to them; and theyknew her, and abused her all the night until the morning: and when the day began to spring, they let her go.\v 26 Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the manâs house where her lord was, till itwas light.\s5\p\v 27 And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way; and, behold, thewoman his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house, with her hands upon the threshold.\v 28 And he said to her, Up, and let us be going; but none answered: then he took her up upon the ass; and the man rose up,and got him to his place.\s5\v 29 And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and divided her, limb by limb, intotwelve pieces, and sent her throughout all the borders of Israel.\v 30 And it was so, that all that saw it said, There was no such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israelcame up out of the land of Egypt to this day: consider it, take counsel, and speak.\s5\c 20\p\v 1 Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation was assembled as one man, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, withthe land of Gilead, to Jehovah at Mizpah.\v 2 And the chiefs of all the people, even of all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people ofGod, four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword.\s5\v 3 (Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel were gone up to Mizpah.) And the children of Israel said,Tell us, how was this wickedness brought to pass?\v 4 And the Levite, the husband of the woman that was murdered, answered and said, I came into Gibeah that belongs toBenjamin, I and my concubine, to lodge.\s5\v 5 And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and beset the house round about me by night; me they thought to have slain, and my concubine they forced, and she is dead.\v 6 And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel; forthey have committed lewdness and folly in Israel.\v 7 Behold, you children of Israel, all of you, give here your advice and counsel.\s5\p\v 8 And all the people arose as one man, saying, We will not any of us go to his tent, neither will we any of us turn to hishouse.\v 9 But now this is the thing which we will do to Gibeah: we will go upagainst it by lot;\s5\v 10 and we will take ten men of a hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and a hundred of a thousand, and a thousandout of ten thousand, to fetch food for the people, that they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according to allthe folly that they have wrought in Israel.\v 11 So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit together as one man.\s5\p\v 12 And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, What wickedness is this that is come to passamong you?\v 13 Now therefore deliver up the men, the base fellows, that are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and put away evilfrom Israel. But Benjamin would not listen to the voice of their brethren the children of Israel.\v 14 And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities to Gibeah, to go out to battle against thechildren of Israel.\s5\v 15 And the children of Benjamin were numbered on that day out of the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword,besides the inhabitants of Gibeah, who were numbered seven hundred chosen men.\v 16 Among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men lefthanded; every one could sling stones at a hair-breadth, and not miss.\s5\p\v 17 And the men of Israel, besides Benjamin, were numbered four hundred thousand men that drew sword: all these were men of war.\v 18 And the children of Israel arose, and went up to Beth-el, and asked counsel of God; and they said, Who shall go up for usfirst to battle against the children of Benjamin? And Jehovah said, Judah shall go up first.\s5\p\v 19 And the children of Israel rose up in the morning, and encamped against Gibeah.\v 20 And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and the men of Israel set the battle in array against them atGibeah.\v 21 And the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah, and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites on that daytwenty and two thousand men.\s5\v 22 And the people, the men of Israel, encouraged themselves, and set the battle again in array in the place where they setthemselves in array the first day.\v 23 And the children of Israel went up and wept before Jehovah until even; and they asked of Jehovah, saying, Shall I againdraw near to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother? And Jehovah said, Go up against him.\s5\p\v 24 And the children of Israel came near against the children of Benjamin the second day.\v 25 And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day, and destroyed down to the ground of the children ofIsrael again eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword.\s5\v 26 Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up, and came to Beth-el, and wept, and sat there beforeJehovah, and fasted that day until even; and they offered burnt offerings and peace-offerings before Jehovah.\s5\v 27 And the children of Israel asked of Jehovah (for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days,\v 28 and Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days), saying, Shall I yet again go out tobattle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease? And Jehovah said, Go up; for to-morrow I will deliver himinto your hand.\s5\p\v 29 And Israel set liers-in-wait against Gibeah round about.\v 30 And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and set themselves in array againstGibeah, as at other times.\s5\v 31 And the children of Benjamin went out against the people, and were drawn away from the city; and they began to strike andkill of the people, as at other times, in the highways, of which one goes up to Beth-el, and the other to Gibeah, in thefield, about thirty men of Israel.\s5\v 32 And the children of Benjamin said, They are struck down before us, as at the first. But the children of Israel said, Letus flee, and draw them away from the city to the highways.\v 33 And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and set themselves in array at Baal-tamar: and the liers-in-wait ofIsrael brake forth out of their place, even out of Maareh-geba.\s5\v 34 And there came over against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and the battle was sore; but they knew notthat evil was close upon them.\v 35 And Jehovah struck Benjamin before Israel; and the children of Israel destroyed of Benjamin that day twenty and fivethousand and a hundred men: all these drew the sword.\s5\p\v 36 So the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten; for the men of Israel gave place to Benjamin, because theytrusted to the liers-in-wait whom they had set against Gibeah.\v 37 And the liers-in-wait hasted, and rushed upon Gibeah; and the liers-in-wait drew themselves along, and struck all the citywith the edge of the sword.\v 38 Now the appointed sign between the men of Israel and the liers-in-wait was, that they should make a great cloud of smokerise up out of the city.\s5\v 39 And the men of Israel turned in the battle, and Benjamin began to strike and kill of the men of Israel about thirtypersons; for they said, Surely they are struck down before us, as in the first battle.\s5\v 40 But when the cloud began to arise up out of the city in a pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them; and,behold, the whole of the city went up in smoke to heaven.\v 41 And the men of Israel turned, and the men of Benjamin were dismayed; for they saw that evil was come upon them.\s5\v 42 Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel to the way of the wilderness; but the battle followed hardafter them; and they that came out of the cities destroyed them in the midst thereof.\s5\v 43 They inclosed the Benjamites round about, and chased them,and trod them down at their resting-place, as far as over against Gibeah toward the sunrising.\v 44 And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these were men of valor.\s5\v 45 And they turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon: and they gleaned of them in the highways fivethousand men, and followed hard after them to Gidom, and struck of them two thousand men.\v 46 So that all who fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five thousand men that drew the sword; all thesewere men of valor.\s5\v 47 But six hundred men turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, and abode in the rock of Rimmon fourmonths.\v 48 And the men of Israel turned again upon the children of Benjamin, and struck them with the edge of the sword, both theentire city, and the cattle, and all that they found: moreover all the cities which they found they set on fire.\s5\c 21\p\v 1 Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpah, saying, There shall not any of us give his daughter to Benjamin to wife.\v 2 And the people came to Beth-el, and sat there till even before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept sore.\v 3 And they said, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, why is this come to pass in Israel, that there should be today one tribelacking in Israel?\s5\v 4 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people rose early, and built there an altar, and offered burnt offerings andpeace-offerings.\v 5 And the children of Israel said, Who is there among all the tribes of Israel that came not up in the assembly toJehovah? For they had made a great oath concerning him that came not up to Jehovah to Mizpah, saying, He shall surely be putto death.\s5\v 6 And the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their brother, and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel thisday.\v 7 How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing we have sworn by Jehovah that we will not give them of ourdaughters to wives?\s5\p\v 8 And they said, What one is there of the tribes of Israel that came not up to Jehovah to Mizpah? And, behold, there camenone to the camp from Jabesh-gilead to the assembly.\v 9 For when the people were numbered, behold, there were none of the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead there.\v 10 And the congregation sent there twelve thousand men of the valiantest, and commanded them, saying, Go and strike theinhabitants of Jabesh-gilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the little ones.\s5\v 11 And this is the thing that you shall do: you shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman that has lain by man.\v 12 And they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead four hundred young virgins, that had not known man by lying withhim; and they brought them to the camp to Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.\s5\p\v 13 And the whole congregation sent and spoke to the children of Benjamin that were in the rock of Rimmon, and proclaimedpeace to them.\v 14 And Benjamin returned at that time; and they gave them the women whom they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh-gilead: and yet so they sufficed them not.\v 15 And the people repented them for Benjamin, because that Jehovah had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.\s5\p\v 16 Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing the women are destroyedout of Benjamin?\v 17 And they said, There must be an inheritance for them that are escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe be not blotted out fromIsrael.\s5\v 18 Howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters, for the children of Israel had sworn, saying, Cursed be he thatgives a wife to Benjamin.\v 19 And they said, Behold, there is a feast of Jehovah from year to year in Shiloh, which is on the north of Beth-el, on theeast side of the highway that goes up from Beth-el to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.\s5\v 20 And they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go and lie in wait in the vineyards,\v 21 and see, and, behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in the dances, then come you out of the vineyards, andcatch you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.\s5\v 22 And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come to complain to us, that we will say to them, Grant themgraciously to us, because we took not for each man of them his wife in battle, neither did you give them to them,else would you now be guilty.\s5\v 23 And the children of Benjamin did so, and took them wives, according to their number, of them that danced, whom theycarried off: and they went and returned to their inheritance, and built the cities, and lived in them.\v 24 And the children of Israel departed thence at that time, every man to his tribe and to his family, and they went out fromthence every man to his inheritance.\s5\p\v 25 In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes.
