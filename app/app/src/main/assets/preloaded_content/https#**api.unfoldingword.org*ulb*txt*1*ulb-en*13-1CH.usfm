\c 10
\p
\v 1 Now the Philistines fought against Israel. The Israelites fled from before the Philistines and fell down dead on Mount Gilboa.
\v 2 The Philistines aggressively pursued Saul and  his son. The Philistines killed Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchishua, the sons of Saul.
\v 3 And the battle went heavily against Saul, and the archers wounded him; and he was writhing in pain because of the archers.

\s5
\v 4 Then said Saul to his armor-bearer, "Draw your sword and thrust me through with it, otherwise these uncircumcised will come and abuse me.
 But his armor bearer would not; for he was very afraid. Therefore Saul took his sword, and fell upon it.

\s5
\v 5 When his armor bearer saw that Saul was dead, he likewise fell on his sword and died.
\v 6 So Saul died, and his three sons, so all his house died together.

\s5
\p
\v 7 When the Israelites who were in the valley saw that they had fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned their cities and fled. Then the Philistines came and lived in them.
\v 8 It came about on the next day, when the Philistines came to strip the dead, that they found Saul and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.

\s5
\v 9 They stripped him, and took his head and his armor, and sent messengers throughout Philistia, to carry the news to their idols and to the people.
\v 10 They put his armor in the temple of their gods, and fastened his head in the Temple of Dagon.

\s5
\v 11 And when all Jabesh Gilead heard of all that the Philistines had done to Saul,
\v 12 all the warriers went out and took away the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh. 
They buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh and fasted seven days.

\s5
\p
\v 13 So Saul died because he was unfaithful to Yahweh, and did not obey the Lord's instructions,
but asked for advice from someone who talked with the dead.

\v 14 He did not seek guidence of of Yahweh: so he killed him, and handed over the kingdom to David the son of Jesse.





\s5
\c 11
\p
\v 1 Then all Israel came to David at Hebron and said, "Look, we are your flesh and bone.
\v 2 In the recent past  when Saul was king over us, it was you who led the Israelite army, and Yahweh your God said to you, 'You will shepherd my people Israel, and you will become ruler over my people Israel.'
\v 3 So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron, and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before Yahweh. They anointed David king over Israel, obeying the word of Yahweh declared by Samuel.

\s5
\p
\v 4 And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem (the same is Jebus), and the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, were there.
\v 5 The inhabitants of Jebus said to David, "You shall not come in here. But David took the stronghold of Zion, which is the City of David.
\v 6 And David said, "Whosoever strikes the Jebusites first will be chief and captain." And Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first, and was made chief.

\s5
\v 7 Then David lived in the stronghold. Therefore they called it the city of David.
\v 8 And he fortified the city around from the terrace and back to it. And Joab repaired the rest of the city.
\v 9 And David became greater and greater, for Yahweh of Hosts was with him.

\s5
\p
\v 10 These are the leaders David had, who showed themselves strong with him in his kingdom, together
with all Israel, to make him king, obeying the word of Yahweh, concerning Israel.
\v 11 This is a list of David's warriers: Jashobeam, the son of a Hachmonite, the chief of the thirty killed 300 men with his spear at one time.

\s5
\v 12 After him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighty men.
\v 13 He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines assembled together for battle, where there was a field
 of barley; and the army fled from the Philistines.
\v 14 They took a stand in the middle of the field and defended it and cut down the Philistines; and Yahweh gave them by a great
victory.

\s5
\p
\v 15 And three of the thirty leaders  went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the army of the
Philistines were encamped in the valley of Rephaim.
\v 16  David was then in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was in Bethlehem.
\v 17 And David said longingly, Oh that one would give me a drink of water from the well of Bethlehem, that is by the gate!

\s5
\v 18 The three broke through the army lines of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the
gate, and brought it to David. David refused to drink of it. but instead poured it out to Yahweh,
\v 19 and said, "My God forbid it me, that I should do this. Should I drink the blood of these men who  have risked their lives 
to bring it to me, for at the risk of their lives they brought it. Therefore he would not drink it. These things the
three warriers did..

\s5
\p
\v 20 Abishai, the brother of Joab,  was leader of the three. He wielded his spear against three hundred and killed
them, and made a name beside the three.
\v 21 Of the thirty, he was most honored and becametheir leader: however he did not attain to the
first three.

\s5
\p
\v 22 Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, a brave warrier from Kabzeel, who had done mighty deeds, killed the two
sons of Ariel of Moab. He also went down and killed a lion in a pit on a snowy day.
\v 23 He even killed an Egyptian, a man seven and a half feet tall. The Egyptian had a spear like a weaver’s
beam, but he went down to him with a staff. He  plucked the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand and killed him with his own spear.

\s5
\v 24 These things Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did and made  a name beside the three warriers.
\v 25 He was more honored than the thirty but was  not one of the
first three.  David put him over his guard.

\s5
\p
\v 26 The mighty warriers were Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,

\c 12
\p
\v 1 These are the men who came to David to Ziklag, while he was still banished  from the presence ofSaul the son of Kish. They
were among the warriers, his helpers in battle.
\v 2 They were armed with bows, and could use both the right hand and the left in slinging stones and in shooting arrows from
the bow. They were Benjaminites Saul’s kinsmen.

\s5
\v 3 The chief was Ahiezer; then Joash, the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite,  Jeziel, and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth, 
Beracah, Jehu the Anathothite,
\v 4  Ishmaiah the Gibeonite, a warrier among the thirty, and over the thirty, Jeremiah, Jahaziel, Johanan,
 Jozabad the Gederathite,

\s5
\v 5 Eluzai, Jerimoth, Bealiah, Shemariah, Shephatiah the Haruphite,
\v 6 Elkanah, Isshiah, Azarel, Joezer,Jashobeam, who were Korahites, and
\v 7  Joelah, and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham of Gedor.

\s5
\p
\v 8 Some Gadites joinedDavid at the stronghold in the wilderness. They were fighting men, men
trained for battle, who could handle shield and spear; whose faces were as fierce as the faces of lions. They were as swift as the
gazelles on the mountains.

\s5
\v 9 There wasEzer the leader, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third,
\v 10 Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth,
\v 11 Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh,
\v 12 Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth,
\v 13 Jeremiah the tenth, Machbannai the eleventh.

\s5
\v 14 These of the sons of Gad were leaders of the army: the least led a hundred, and the greatest led a
thousand.
\v 15 They crossed the Jordan in the first month, when it overflowed its banks; and they chased away
all those living in the valleys, both toward the east and toward the west.

\s5
\p
\v 16 Some of the men of Benjamin and Judah came to the stronghold to David.
\v 17 David went out to meet them, and addressed  them, "If you be come peaceably to me to help me, you may join me,
 but if you be come to betray me to my adversaries, seeing I have not done wrong, the
God of our fathers will see and  and rebuke you.

\s5
\v 18 Then the Spirit came upon Amasai, who was chief of the thirty, and he said, "We are yours, David. We are on your side, you son of Jesse. Peace, peace to him who helps you, Peace be to your helpers, for your God helps you. "Then David received them, and made them leaders of the troops

\s5
\p
\v 19 Some from Manasseh also deserted to David, when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle. Yet they did not help the Philistines, because the lords of the Philistines upon advisement sent David away, saying, "He will desert to his master Saul to the
jeopardy of our heads."
\v 20 When he went to Ziklag, the men  of Manasseh who joined him were Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai, captains of thousands of Manasseh.

\s5
\v 21 They helped David fight against the roving bands, for they were fighting men and captains in the army.
\v 22 From day to day men came to David to help him, until there was a great army, like the army of God.

\s5
\p
\v 23 This is the record of the armed soldiers for war, who came to David to Hebron, to turn the kingdom
of Saul over to him, that was following the word of Yahweh.
\v 24 From Judah those who carried shield and spear were 6,800, armed for war.
\v 25 Of the Simeonites were 7,100 fighting men.

\s5
\v 26 Of the Levites there were 4,600 fighting men.
\v 27  Jehoiada was the leader of of Aaron's descendants, and with him were 3,700,
\v 28 and Zadok, a young strong, and courageous man,  with twenty two leaders from his father's family.

\s5
\v 29 From Benjamin, Saul's tribe were 3,000, most  of them had remained loyal
 to Saul until that time.
\v 30 Of the Ephraimites 20,800 fighting men, famous men in their fathers’
families.
\v 31 Of the half-tribe of Manasseh 18,000, who were mentioned by name came to make David king.

\s5
\v 32 From Issachar, there were 200 leaders who  had understanding of the times and  knew what Israel ought to do.
All their relatives were under  their command.
\v 33 From Zebulun 50,000 fighting men, prepared for battle, with all the weapons
of war, and ready to give undivided loyalty.
.

\s5
\v 34 From Naphtali a thousand officers, and with them 37,000 men with shields and spears.
\v 35 From the Danites there wer 28,600 men prepared for battle..

\s5
\v 36 From Asher there were 40,000 men prepared for battle..
\v 37 And from the other side of the Jordan, of the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and of the half-tribe of Manasseh there were 120,000 men armed with all
kinds of weapons  for the battle.

\s5
\p
\v 38 All these warriers, arrayed in battle order, came with resolute intention to Hebron, to make David king
over all Israel. All the rest of Israel were in agreement to make David king also.
\v 39 They were there with David three days, eating and drinking; for their relatives had sent them with provisions.
\v 40 Moreover they that were near to them, even as far as Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, brought bread on
donkeys, camels, mules, and on oxen, cakes of figs, clusters of raisins, wine, oil,
 oxen, and sheep, for Israel was celebrating.





\s5
\c 13
\p
\v 1  David consulted with the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with every leader.
\v 2  David said to all the assembly of Israel, "If it seem good to you, and if it be of Yahweh our God, let us send 
 everywhere to our brethren who remain in all the lands of Israel, and to the priests and Levites who are in their
cities, that they may join us.
\v 3 Let us bring the ark of our God back to us, for we did not seek his will in the days of Saul's reign."
\v 4 The whole assembly agreed to do it,  for the thing seemed right in the eyes of all the people.

\s5
\v 5 So David assembled all Israel together, from the Shihor River 
in Egypt even to Lebo Hamath, to bring the ark of God from Kiriathjearim.
\v 6 David and all Israel went up to Baalah, that is, to Kiriath-jearim, which belongs to Judah, to bring up
 the ark of God Yahweh from there, who sits enthroned above the cherubim. The ark  is called by his Name.

\s5
\v 7 And they carried the ark of God on a new cart, and brought it
out of the house of Abinadab.  Uzza and Ahio were guiding the cart.
\v 8 David and all Israel celebrated before God with all their might,with singing, with string insturments,
with tamberines, with cymbals, and with trumpets.

\s5
\p
\v 9 When they came to the threshing floor of Chidon, Uzza reached out his hand to steady the ark, because the oxen stumbled.
\v 10 Yahweh was angry with Uzza, and he killed  him, because he reached out his hand to touch the ark. He died right there
 before God.
\v 11 David was angry, because Yahweh attacked Uzza. He called that place Perez-uzza, to this day.

\s5
\v 12 David was afraid of God that day, saying, "How can I bring the ark of God home to me?"
\v 13 So David did not move the ark to the city of David, but left it in the house of Obededom the
Gittite.
\v 14 The ark of God remained with the family of Obededom in his house three months. Yahweh blessed the house of
Obededom, and all that he possessed.





\s5
\c 14
\p
\v 1 Then Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and carpenters , and masons. They built a palace for David. 
\v 2 David knew that Yahweh had established him as king over Israel, 
for his kingdom was exalted on high, for the sake of his people Israel.

\s5
\p
\v 3 And David took more wives at Jerusalem,and David became the father of more sons and daughters.
\v 4 These are the names of the children who were born to him  in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,
\v 5 Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet,
\v 6 Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia,
\v 7 Elishama, Beeliada, and Eliphelet.

\s5
\p
\v 8 Now when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went out looking for David.
 But  David heard about it and went out against them.
\v 9 Now the Philistines had come and made a raid in the valley of Rephaim.

\s5
\v 10 Then David sought the counsel of God saying, "Should I go up against the Philistines? Will you deliver them into my hand?" Yahweh answered David, "Go up,  for I will deliver them into your hand."
\v 11 So David came up to Baal-perazim, and there David defeated them. He commented. "God has burst through my enemies by my hand, like a bursting flood of waters." 
Therefore the name of that place became "Baal-perazim," Yahweh bursts through.
\v 12 And they abandoned their gods there, and David gave an order that  they be burned.

\s5
\p
\v 13 And the Philistines yet again raided  the valley.
\v 14 So David sought the counsel of God again,  and God said to him, "You must not attack their front, but rather circle around behind them through the balsam woods.

\s5
\v 15 When you hear the sound of marching in the wind blowing through  tops of the balsam treetops, then decisively attack because God has gone out before you to strike the army of the Philistines."
\v 16 So David did as God commanded him and drove the army of the Philistines from Gibeon all the way to Gezer.
\v 17 And the fame of David went out into all lands, and Yahweh caused all nations to fear him.





\s5
\c 15
\p
\v 1 David built houses for himself in the city of David, and he prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched a
tent for it
\v 2 Then David said, "Only the Levites may carry the ark of God, for Yahweh has chosen them to carry the ark of God,
and to minister to him forever.
\v 3 Then David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of Yahweh to the place  he had prepared for it.

\s5
\v 4  David gathered together the descendants of Aaron, and the Levites:
\v 5 of the sons of Kohath, Uriel the chief, and his brothers, 120 men;
\v 6 of the sons of Merari, Asaiah the chief, and his brothers, 220 men;

\s5
\v 7 of the sons of Gershom, Joel the chief, and his brothers, 130 men;
\v 8 of the sons of Elizaphan, Shemaiah the chief, and his brothers, 200 men;
\v 9 of the sons of Hebron, Eliel the chief, and his brothers, 80 men;
\v 10 of the sons of Uzziel, Amminadab the chief, and his brothers, 112 men.

\s5
\v 11  David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and of the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah,
Eliel, and Amminadab.
\v 12 He said to them, "You are the leaders of the Levite families;
 sanctify yourselves, both you and your brothers, that you may bring up the ark of Yahweh, the God of
Israel, to the place that I have prepared for it.

\s5
\v 13 You did not carry it the first time. That is why Yahweh our God broke out against us, for we did not seek him, or obey his decree.
\v 14 So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of Yahweh, the God of Israel.
\v 15 So the Levites carried the ark of God upon their shoulders with the poles, as Moses commanded—
following the rules given by the word of Yahweh.

\s5
\p
\v 16 And David spoke to the leaders of the Levites to appoint their brothers as the singers, with instruments of music, stringed insturments,
 harps and cymbals, playing loudly and lifting up their voices, joyfully.
\v 17 So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel and of his brothers, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and brothers from  the sons of
Merari, Ethan the son of Kushaiah;
\v 18 and with them their brothers of the second rank, Zechariah, Ben, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni,
Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-edom, and Jeiel, the doorkeepers.

\s5
\v 19 The musicians Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were appointed to sound loud cymbals of brass.
\v 20 Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah played the stringed insturments,
set to Alamoth;
\v 21 Mattithiah, Eliphelehu,Mikneiah, Obed-edom, Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps set to the Sheminith, 
led the way..

\s5
\v 22 Chenaniah, leader of the Levites in the singing, directed the singing because he was skilful.
\v 23 Berechiah and Elkanah were guardians for the ark.
\v 24 Shebaniah, Joshaphat,  Nethanel, Amasai,Zechariah,Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, were to blow
the trumpets before the ark of God.  Obed-edom and Jehiah were guardians for the ark.

\s5
\p
\v 25 So David, the elders of Israel, and the commanders over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of Yahweh
out of the house of Obed-edom with rejoicing.
\v 26 While God helped the Levites who carried the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, they sacrificed seven
bulls and seven rams.

\s5
\v 27 David was clothed with a robe of fine linen,as were the Levites who carried the ark, the singers, and Chenaniah
the leader of the song with the singers.  David was wearing a linen ephod.
\v 28 So all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of Yahweh with joyful shouting, and with sound of horns, 
 with cymbals,  with stringed insturments and harps.

\s5
\p
\v 29 But  as the ark of the covenant of Yahweh came to the city of David, Michal, the daughter of Saul,
looked out of the window, and saw king David dancing and playing; and she despised him in her heart.





\s5
\c 16
\p
\v 1 They brought in the ark of God and set it in the middle of the tent that David had pitched for it. Then  they offered
burnt offerings and peace-offerings before God.
\v 2 When David had finished sacrificing the burnt offering and the peace-offerings, he blessed the people in the name
of Yahweh.
\v 3 He distributed to every Israelite, both man and woman, a loaf of bread, and a piece
of meat, and a cake of raisins.

\s5
\p
\v 4 He appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark of Yahweh, and to celebrate, thank and praise
Yahweh, the God of Israel.
\v 5 These were Asaph the leader, and second to him Zechariah, Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah,
 Obed-edom, and Jeiel.  These were to play with stringed insturments and with harps. Asaph was to sound the  cymbals, sounding loudly.
\v 6 Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests were to blow the horns regularly, 
before the ark of the covenant of God.

\s5
\p
\v 7 Then on that day David first appointed Assaph and his brothers to sing this song of thanksgiving to Yahweh.
\q
\v 8 Give thanks to Yahweh, call on his name;
\q Make known his deeds among the nations.
\q
\v 9 Sing to him, sing praises to him;
\q Speak of all his marvelous deeds.

\s5
\q
\v 10 Boast in his holy name;
\q Let the heart of those who seek Yahweh rejoice.
\q
\v 11 Seek Yahweh and his strength;
\q Seek his presence continually.

\s5
\q
\v 12 Recall the marvelous works that he has done,
\q His miracles, and the judgments from his mouth,
\q
\v 13 O you descendants of Israel his servant,
\q You people of Jacob, his chosen ones.
\q
\v 14 He is Yahweh, our God.
\q His judgments are upon all the earth.

\s5
\q
\v 15 Remember his covenant forever,
\q The word that he commanded for a thousand generations,
\q
\v 16 The covenant that he made with Abraham,
\q And his oath to Isaac,
\q
\v 17 which he confirmed  to Jacob as a statute,
\q to Israel as an everlasting covenant,
\q
\v 18 He said, "I will give you the land of Canaan
\q as the portion for your inheritance."

\s5
\q
\v 19 When you were but a few in number,
\q so very few, and were strangers in it.
\q
\v 20 They went from nation to nation,
\q from one kingdom to another.
\q
\v 21 He did not allow anyone to oppress them;
\q  he disciplined kings for their sakes,
\q
\v 22 he said, "Do not touch my anointed ones,
\q And do not harm my prophets."

\s5
\q
\v 23 Sing to Yahweh, all the earth;
\q Announce his salvation day after day.
\q
\v 24 Declare his glory among the nations,
\q His marvelous deeds among all the nations.

\s5
\q
\v 25 For great is Yahweh, and greatly to be praised.
\q He is to be feared above all gods.
\q
\v 26 For all the gods of the nations are idols.
\q But Yahweh made the heavens.
\q
\v 27 Splendor and majesty are in his presence.
\q Strength and gladness are in his place.

\s5
\q
\v 28 Ascribe to Yahweh, you familes of nations,
\q Ascribe to Yahweh glory and strength;
\q
\v 29 Ascribe to Yahweh the glory due to his name;
\q Bring an offering, and come before him;
\q Worship Yahweh in the glory of holiness.

\s5
\q
\v 30 Tremble before him, all the earth;
\q The world is established, it cannot be moved.
\q
\v 31 Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice;
\q And let them say among the nations, Yahweh reigns.

\s5
\q
\v 32 Let the sea roar, and and that which fills it shout,
\q Let the field be joyful, and all that is in it.
\q
\v 33 Then let  the trees of the forest sing for joy before Yahweh;
\q For he is coming to judge the earth.

\s5
\q
\v 34 O give thanks to Yahweh; for he is good;
\q For his lovingkindness endures forever.
\q
\v 35 And say, "Save us, O God of our salvation,
\q and gather us together and deliver us from the nations,
\q that we may give thanks to your holy name,
\q and glory in your praise."

\s5
\q
\v 36 Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel,
\q From everlasting to everlasting.
\m And all the people said, "Amen," and praised Yahweh.

\s5
\p
\v 37 So David left Asaph and his brothers before the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, to minister before the ark continually, as every day’s work required.
\v 38 Obed-edom with those 68 brothers were included. Obed-edom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah were to be doorkeepers.
\v 39 Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests were to serve before the tabernacle of Yahweh in the high place at Gibeon.

\s5
\v 40 They were to offer burnt offerings to Yahweh upon the altar of burnt offering continually morning and evening, even following all that is written in the law of Yahweh, which he commanded to Israel.
\v 41 Heman and Jeduthun, were with them and the rest that were chosen, who were mentioned by name, to give thanks to Yahweh, because his lovingkindness endures for ever;

\s5
\v 42  Heman and Jeduthun joined them with  trumpets and cymbals used by those
with other instruments for the sacredsongs. The sons of Jeduthun guarded the gate.
\v 43 Then all the people returned to there homes and David returned to bless his household.





\s5
\c 17
\p
\v 1 When David settled in his house, he said to Nathan the prophet," Look, I am living in a house of cedar, but the ark of the covenant of Yahweh lives under a tent."
\v 2 And Nathan said to David, "Do what is in your heart, for God is with you."

\s5
\v 3 But the same night the word of God came to Nathan saying,
\v 4 "Go and tell David my servant, "This is what  Yahweh says, You will not build me a house in which to live,
\v 5 for I have not lived in a house from the day that I brought up Israel, to this day, but have lived in a tent  in various places.

\v 6 In all places I have moved with Israel did I speak a word with any of the leaders of Israel, whom I appointed to shepherd my people, saying, Why have you not built me a house of cedar?

\s5
\v 7 Now therefore tell my servant David, This is what Yahweh of hosts says, I took you from the pasture, from
following the sheep, that you should be prince over my people Israel.
\v 8 And I have been with you wherever you went and have cut off all your enemies from before you. And I will make you a name, like the name of the great ones of the earth.

\s5
\v 9 And I will appoint a place for my people Israel and will plant them, so that they may make their homes in their own place and be disturbed no more. And wicked people will not oppress them any more, as they did before,
\v 10 from the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel. And I will subdue all your enemies.
Moreover I tell you that Yahweh will build you a house.

\s5
\v 11 And it will come about when your days are fulfilled that you must go to be with your fathers, I will raise up your descendants after you, and for one of your own descendants I will establish his kingdom.
\v 12 He will build me a house, and I will establish his throne forever.

\s5
\v 13 I will be a father to him, and he will be my son. I will not take my steadfast love away from him, as I took it from Saul who ruled before you. 
\v 14 I will set him over my house and in my kingdom forever, and his throne will be established forever.'"
\v 15 With all these words, and by all this vision, Nathan spoke to David.

\s5
\p
\v 16 Then David the king went in and sat before Yahweh and he said, "Who am I, O Yahweh God, and what is my family, that you have brought me to this point?
\v 17 And this was a small thing in your sight, O God, but you have spoken of your servant’s family for a great while to come, and have shown me future generations, O Yahweh God.
\v 18 What more can David say to you? You have honored your servant. You have given your servant special recognition.
\s5
\v 19 O Yahweh, for your servant’s sake, and fulfilling your own purpose, you have done this great thing to make your greatness known .
\v 20 O Yahweh, there is none like you, and there is no God besides you, just as we have alwaysheard.

\v 21 And what nation in the earth is like your people Israel, whom God redeemed from Egypt as a people for himself,  to make a name for you by great and awesome deeds. You  drove out nations from before your people, whom you redeemed out of Egypt.

\s5
\v 22 You made  Israel  your own people forever, and you, Yahweh, became their God.
\v 23 So now,  Yahweh, may the promise you made concerning your servant, and concerning his family, be established forever. Do as you have spoken.
\v 24 May your name be great and magnified forever, as the people say, "Yahweh of armies is the God of Israel," while the dynasty of David your servant is established in your presence.

\s5
\v 25 For you, O my God, have revealed to your servant that you will build him a dynasty. Therefore your servant has found courage to pray to you.
\v 26 Now, O Yahweh, you are truly God, and have made this  good promise to your servant:
\v 27 Now it has pleased you to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue forever before you. You, O
Yahweh, have blessed it, and it is blessed forever.





\s5
\c 18
\p
\v 1 After this it came about that David attacked the Philistines and defeated them. He took Gath and its towns out of the control of the Philistines.
\v 2 Then he defeated Moab, and the Moabites became servants to David  and paid tribute.

\s5
\p
\v 3 David then defeated Hadarezer,  king of Zobah to Hamath, as he went to establish his rule by the Euphrates River.
\v 4 David captured from him a thousand chariots, and seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen. David hamstrung all the chariot horses, but reserved enough of them for a hundred chariots.

\s5
\p
\v 5 And when the Arameans of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king of Zobah, David struck down twenty-two thousand Aramean men.
\v 6 Then David put garrisons in Aram of Damascus; and the Arameans became servants to David, and brought tribute. And Yahweh gave victory to David wherever he went.

\s5
\v 7 And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.
\v 8 And from Tibhath and from Cun, cities of Hadarezer, David took very much bronze, with which Solomon made the bronze sea, and the stone pillars, and the vessels of bronze.

\s5
\p
\v 9 When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had defeated all the army of Hadadezer king of Zobah,
\v 10 Toi sent Hadoram his son to king David to greet him and to bless him, because David had fought against Hadadezer and defeated him and because Hadadezer had waged war against with Toi. Hadoram had with him vessels of gold and silver and bronze.
\v 11 These vessels King David dedicated to Yahweh, with the silver and the gold that he carried away from all the nations: Edom, Moab, the people of Ammon, the Philistines, and from Amalek.

\s5
\p
\v 12 Abishai the son of Zeruiah killed 18,000 Edomites in the Valley of Salt.
\v 13 He placed garrisons in Edom,  and all the Edomites became David's servants. Yahweh gave victory to David
wherever he went.

\s5
\p
\v 14 And David reigned over all Israel,  and he administered justice and righteousness to all his people.
\v 15 Joab the son of Zeruiah was the commander of the army, and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder.
\v 16 Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar, were priests, and Shavsha was scribe.
\v 17 Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites, and David's sons were the king's leading officers






\s5
\c 19
\p
\v 1 Afterward Nahash the king of the Ammonites died, and his son reigned in his place.
\v 2  David said, "I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me." So David sent envoys to console him concerning his father. But when David’s servants entered the land of the Ammonites to Hanun, to
console him, \v 3 the princes of Ammon said to Hanun, "Do you really think that David honors your father and has sent comforters to you? Don't his servants come to you to explore and spy out the land, to overthrow it."

\s5
\v 4 So Hanun seized David’s servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments to the waist, exposing their buttocks, and
sent them away.
\v 5 Messengers came and told David how the men were treated. So he sent messengers to meet them, for the men were
greatly disgraced. The king said, "Stay at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return."

\s5
\p
\v 6 When the Ammonites saw that they had offended David, Hanun and the Ammonites sent a thousand talents of silver to hire chariots and horsemen from Mesopotamia, Aram-maacah, and Zobah.
\v 7 They hired them 32,000 chariots, with the king of Maacah and his people, who came and encamped before
Medeba. The Ammonites gathered themselves together from their cities, and came out for war.

\s5
\v 8 When David heard of it, he sent Joab and his entire army to meet them..
\v 9 The people of Ammon came out and lined up for battle at the gate of the city, while the kings who had  come were
by themselves in the field.

\s5
\p
\v 10 When Joab saw that the battle was set against him, both before and behind him,, he chose some of Israel's best fighters and deployed them, against the Arameans.
\v 11 The rest of the army he committed to the charge  of Abishai his brother; and they deployed against the Ammonites.

\s5
\v 12 And he said, "If the Arameans be too strong for me, then you must help me; but if the Ammonites be too strong for you, then I will help you.
\v 13 Be strong, Let us be courageous for our people, and for the cities of our God. Yahweh wil do what he decides is best.

\s5
\v 14 So Joab and the people that were with him marched toward the Arameans, to do battle, but they fled before him.
\v 15 When the Ammonites saw that the Arameans fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered
 their city. Then Joab returned to Jerusalem.

\s5
\p
\v 16 And when the Arameans saw that they were defeated by Israel, they sent for reinforcements beyond the Euphrates River, with Shophach the commander of Hadarezer,s army.
\v 17 When this was reported to David, and he gathered all Israel together and passed over the Jordan andcame upon them. He deployed the army for battle
  against the Arameans, and they fought against him.

\s5
\v 18 The Arameans fled before Israel, and David killed 7,000 Aramean charioteers, 40,000 foot soldiers, and killed Shophach, the commander of the army.
\v 19 And when the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were defeated by Israel, they made peace with David and
became  his subjects and were no longer willing to help the  the Arameans.





\s5
\c 20
\p
\v 1 In the spring, at the time when kings go out
to battle,  Joab led  the army into battle  and wasted the country of the Ammonites. He went and besieged
Rabbah. David remained in Jerusalem. Joab attacked Rabbah, and defeated it.

\s5
\v 2 David took the crown of their king from off his head, and he found that it weighed a talent of gold, and in it there were precious stones. The crown was set upon David’s head, and he brought out the spoil of the city in large quantities.
\v 3 He brought out the people who were in the city and forced them to labor with saws and iron picks and axes. David required all the cities of the people of Ammon to do this labor. Then David and all the army returned to Jerusalem.

\s5
\p
\v 4 After this there arose a battle at Gezer with the Philistines.  Sibbecai the Hushathite killed
Sippai, of the descendants of the Rephaim; and the Philistines were subdued.
\v 5 There was another battle with the Philistines, and Elhanan, the son of Jair, killed Lahmi, the brother of Goliath the Gittite,
 whose spear's shaft was as long as a weaver’s beam.

\s5
\v 6 There was again battle at Gath, where there was  a large man who had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot.
He also was descended from the Rephaim.
\v 7 When he taunted Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea, David’s brother killed him.
\v 8 These were descendants of the Rephaim of Gath, who died by the hands of David and his servants.



*
 
\s5
\c 21
\p
\v 1   An adversarystood up against Israel, and incited David to take a census of Israel.
\v 2 And David said to Joab and to the commanders of the army Go, number Israel from Beer-sheba to Dan and report back to me,
that I may know the number of them.
\v 3 And Joab said, may Yahweh make  his army a hundred times greater than it is, But, My lord,  O king, Do  they not all serve my
lord. Why does my lord require this thing? Why bring guilt upon Israel?
 
\s5
\v 4 But the king’s word prevailed against Joab. So Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came back to
Jerusalem.
\v 5 And Joab gave the census numbers of the people to David. And all they of Israel were 1,100,000
 sword-wielding soldiers.  Judah alone had 470,000 soldiers.
 
\s5
\v 6 Levi and Benjamin were not counted  among them, for the king’s word disgusted Joab.
\v 7 And God was offended  by it; therefore he struck Israel.
\v 8 David said to God, I have sinned greatly by doing this, Now take  away your servant's guilt,
 for I have acted very foolishly.
 
\s5
\p
\v 9 Yahweh told Gad, David’s prophet,
\v 10 "Go say David, This is what Yahweh says, I offer you three options.  Choose you one of them.

 
\s5
\v 11 So Gad went  to David, and said to him, Thus says Yahweh, Pick one of these:
\v 12 either three years of famine, three months to being  chased by your enemies and being struck down by their swords, or
 else three days of Yahweh's sword, with a plague in the land, with the angel of Yahweh destroying throughout all
land of Israel. Now therefore decide what answer am I to give to him that sent me.
 
\s5
\v 13 Then David said to Gad, I am in a great trouble. Let me fall into the hand of Yahweh, for his mercy is very great,
rather than into the hands of man.
\v 14 So Yahweh sent a plague upon Israel, and 70,000 Israelite men died.
\v 15 And God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it. As he was about to destroy,Yahweh watched and changed his mind 
about the calamity, and said to the destroying angel, It is enough; stay your hand. The angel of Yahweh was standing by the
threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
 
\s5
\v 16 And David looked up, and saw the angel of Yahweh standing between earth and heaven, having a drawn sword in his
hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces.
\v 17 David said to God, Is it not I that commanded that the army be numbered? I did this wicked thing.
But these sheep, what have they done? Let your hand,  O Yahweh my God,  strike me and my
family; but remove the plague from your people.
 
\s5
\p
\v 18 So the angel of Yahweh commanded Gad to say to David, that David should go up, and build an altar to Yahweh on the
threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
\v 19 David went up as Gad instructed him to do  in the name of Yahweh.
\v 20 While Ornan was threshing wheat, he turned and saw the angel.  He and  his four sons who were with him hid themselves.

 
\s5
\v 21 When David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David. He left  the threshing-floor and bowed to David
with his face to the ground.
\v 22 Then David said to Ornan, "Sell me  this threshing-floor, so I can build  an altar to Yahweh. 
tI wil pay the full price, that the plague may be removed from the people."
 
\s5
\v 23 And Ornan said to David, "Take it as your own my lord the king' Do with it  what  is good in our sight. See, I give
you the oxen for burnt-offerings, the threshing sledges for wood, and the wheat for the grain offering; I
give it all to you.
\v 24 King David said to Ornan, "No,  I insist on  buying  it for the full price.  I will not take what is yours and offer it, a burnt offering to
 Yahweh, that costs me nothing..
 
\s5
\v 25 So David paid Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold.
\v 26 David built there an altar to Yahweh, and offered burnt offerings and peace-offerings. He called upon Yahweh, who
answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering.
\v 27 Then Yahweh commanded the angel; and he put up his sword back into its sheath.
 
\s5
\p
\v 28 At that time, when David saw that Yahweh had answered him at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, he
sacrificed there.
\v 29 The tabernacle of Yahweh, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt-offering, were at that time in the high place at Gibeon,
\v 30 but David could not go before it to seek the counsel of God; for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of Yahweh.
 





\s5
\c 22
\p
\v 1 Then David said, This is where  the house of Yahweh God will be, with  the altar of burnt offering for Israel.
\p
\v 2 And David ordered to gather together the resident foreigners in the land of Israel; and he appointed them stonecutters
to hew  stone blocks, to build the house of God.

\s5
\v 3  David supplied a large amount of iron for the nails for the doors of the gates and for braces, as well as more bronze 
than could be weighed,
\v 4 and more cedar trees than could be counted. (The Sidonians and the Tyrians brought a large amount of cedar logs to David.)
\v 5 David said, "My son Solomon is young and inexperienced, and the house that is to be built for Yahweh must be especially
magnificent, so that it is renowned and glorious in all countries. I will therefore make preparation for it. So David made 
extensive preparations, before his death.

\s5
\p
\v 6 Then he called for Solomon his son and charged him to build a house for Yahweh, the God of Israel.
\v 7 And David said to Solomon "My son, It was  my purpose to build a house, myself, to the name of Yahweh my God.
\v 8 But Yahweh came to me, saying, You have shed much blood and have fought many battles. You will not
build a house to my name, because you have shed much blood upon the earth in my sight.

\s5
\v 9 However, you will have a son, who will be a peaceful man.  I will give him rest from all his enemies on every side,
 For Solomon will be his name, and I will give peace and quiet to Israel in his days.
\v 10 He will build a house for my name, and he will become  my son, and I will be his father, and I will establish the throne of
his kingdom over Israel forever."

\s5
\v 11 Now, my son, Yahweh be with you and prosper you. May you build the house of Yahweh your God, as he has said you would.

\v 12 Only may Yahweh give you insight and understanding, when he places you in charge over Israel, so that you may obey the
law of Yahweh your God.
\v 13 Then you will prosper, if you carefully obey the statutes and the decrees which Yahweh ordered Moses 
concerning Israel. Be strong and courageous .Do notfear or be troubled.

\s5
\v 14 Now, see,  I have prepared for the house of Yahweh a 100,000talents of gold, and 1,000,000
 talents of silver, and brass and iron in large quantity. I have also provided  timber and stone.
 To these you must add. 

\s5
\v 15 You have many workmen with you: stonecutters , masons carpenters, and many skillful craftsmen
in every craft,
\v 16 working with gold,  silver, brass, and  iron. Arise and work, and Yahweh will be with you."

\s5
\p
\v 17 David also ordered all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son,
saying,
\v 18 "Yahweh your God is with you and has he given you peace on every side. He has handed over to me  the inhabitants of
the land and the land is subdued before Yahweh, and his people.
\v 19 Now seek Yahweh your God wholeheartedly. Get up and build you the sanctuary of Yahweh
God.  Then you can bring the ark of the covenant of Yahweh and the holy vessels of God, into the house built for the name
of Yahweh.





\s5
\c 23
\p
\v 1 When David was old and near the end of life, he made Solomon his son king over Israel.
\v 2 He gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites.
\v 3 The Levites were counted,  who were thirty years old and older, and the total was 38,000.


\s5
\v 4 Of these, 24,000 were to oversee the work of the house of Yahweh; and 6,000 were officers and
judges;
\v 5 4,ooo were gatekeepers; and 4,000 were to praise Yahweh with the instruments "which I made
for worship,"said David.
\v 6 And David divided them into groups, corresponding to the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.

\s5
\p
\v 7 Of the Gershonites: Ladan and Shimei.
\v 8 Of Ladan's sons, three: Jehiel the chief, and Zetham, and Joel.
\v 9 Of Shimei, three sons: Shelomoth, Haziel, and Haran. These were the leaders of  of the family of Ladan.

\s5
\v 10 The sons of Shimei were Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and Beriah. These were the four sons of Shimei.
\v 11 Jahath was the leader, and Zizah the second, but Jeush and Beriah had not many sons; therefore they were considered one 
family with one responsibility.

\s5
\p
\v 12 The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.
\v 13 The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses.Aaron and his descendants were separated on a permanent basis to consecrate the most holy items, 
 to offer sacrifice before Yahweh, to minister to him, and to bless in his name, forever.
\v 14 But as for Moses the man of God, his sons were considered Levites. 

\s5
\v 15 The sons of Moses: Gershom and Eliezer.
\v 16 The sons of Gershom: Shebuel the oldest.
\v 17 The son of Eliezers was Rehabiah. Eliezer had no other sons, but Rehabiah had many descendants.
\v 18 The sons of Izhar: Shelomith the chief.

\s5
\v 19 The sons of Hebron: Jeriah the 0ldest, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.
\v 20 The sons of Uzziel: Micah the oldest, and Isshiah the second.

\s5
\p
\v 21 The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Mahli: Eleazar and Kish.
\v 22 And Eleazar died without having sons. He only had  daughters. The sons of Kish married them

\v 23 The sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder, and Jeremoth, three in all.

\s5
\p
\v 24 These were the descendants of Levi corresponding to their families, the leaders  of their  families as they were counted and listed by name, who did the work for the service of the house of Yahweh, from twenty years old and upward.
\v 25 For David said, Yahweh, the God of Israel, has given rest to his people; and he makes his home in Jerusalem forever.
\v 26 The Levites will no longer need to carry the tabernacle and all the vessels used in its service.

\s5
\v 27 For by David's last words the Levites were counted, from twenty years old and upward.
\v 28 For their duty was to assist Aaron's descendants in the service of the house of Yahweh.  They were to care for the courtyards, the
rooms, ceremonial purification of all holy items, and other work in the service of the house of God.
\v 29 They also  took care of the showbread,  the fine flour for a grain offering, the unleavened wafers, the baked offering, 
the offering mixed with oil, and all measuring  of quanity and size. 



\s5
\v 30 They also  stood every morning to thank and praise Yahweh. They also did this in the evening,
\v 31 and whenever burnt offerings were offered to Yahweh, on the sabbath and at the new moons festivals and feast days, a designated number, taken from the decree, must always be present before Yahweh.

\s5
\v 32 They were in charge of the tent of meeting, the holy place, and helped the descendants
of Aaron their brothers, in the service of the house of Yahweh.





\s5
\c 24
\p
\v 1 The divisions of Aaron's descendantswere these: Nadab Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.
\v 2 Nadab and Abihu died before their father died;  they had no children, and therefore Eleazar and Ithamar served as  priests.

\v 3 David with Zadok a descendant of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of descendant of Ithamar, divided them into groups for their
priestly service.

\s5
\v 4 And there were more leading men among  the descendants of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar; so they divided of the descendants of Eleazar  into sixteen groups by heads of families and of the descendants of
Ithamar, corresponding to their families, eight groups.
\v 5 They divided them by lot, impartially; for there were officials of the sanctuary, and officials of God, both of
the descendants of Eleazar, and of the descendants of Ithamar.

\s5
\v 6 Shemaiah the son of Nethanel the scribe, a Levite, wrote down their names in the presence of the king,  the
officials,  Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and the leaders of the priestly and
 Levites families.  One family was drawn by lot from Eleazar, and then one taken from  Ithamar.

\s5
\p
\v 7 The first lot went  to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah,
\v 8 the third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim,
\v 9 the fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin,

\v 17 the twenty-first to Jachin, the twenty-second to Gamul,
\v 18 the twenty-third to Delaiah, the twenty-fourth to Maaziah.

\s5
\v 19 This was the order of their service, when they came into the house of Yahweh, following the procedure given to them by Aaron their father, as Yahweh, the God of Israel, had instructed him.

\s5
\p
\v 20 The rest of Leviites of included  Shubael; of the sons of Shubael, Jehdeiah.

\s5
\v 29 From Kish: Jerahmeel.
\v 30 And the sons of Mushi were Mahli, Eder, and Jerimoth. These were the Levites listed by their families.
\v 31 These likewise cast lots just like the descendants of Aaron in the presence of David the king, Zadok,
Ahimelech, and the leaders  of the families of the priests and Levites. 
The families of the oldest son cast lots along with those of the youngest.





\s5
\c 25
\p
\v 1 David and the leaders of the liturgy set apart for the service some of the sons of Asaph, Heman, and 
Jeduthun, who prophesied with harps, with stringed insturments, and with cymbals. This is  list of them who performed

\v 24 Joab the son of Zeruiah began to count the men, but did not finish. Wrath fell  upon Israel for this. So the number  was not

the king by course, and the commanders of thousands, and the commanders of hundreds, and the stewards over all the property and
possessions of the king and of his sons, with the officers, and the fighting men, including the most skilled of them, to
Jerusalem.

\s5
\v 2 Then David the king rose to  his feet, and said, "Listen to me, my brothers, and my people,  it was my purpose
to build a temple for the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, a footstool of our God, and I have made preparation for the
building.
\v 3 But God said to me, You will not build a temple for my name, because you are a man of war, and have shed blood.

\s5
\v 4 Yet Yahweh, the God of Israel, chose me out of all my father's family, to be king over Israel as a permanent dynasty. He
has chosen Judah as leader; and in the house of Judah, the house of my father. Among the sons of my father he picked
 me to make me king over all Israel.
\v 5 From the many sons  Yahweh has given me, he chose Solomon, my son, to rule on his behalf over the
kingdom of Yahweh, over Israel.

\s5
\v 6 And he said to me, "Solomon, your son will build my house and my courts, for I have chosen him to be my son, and I
will be his father.
\v 7 And I will establish his kingdom forever, if he remains committed to obey my commandments and decrees, as you are this day."

\s5
\v 8 "Now therefore, in the sight of all Israel, the assembly of Yahweh, and in the presence of our God, keep and carry out
all the commandments of Yahweh your God; that you may possess this good land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children
after you forever.

\s5
\p
\v 9 And you, Solomon my son, obey  the God of your father, and serve him with your whole heart and with a willing spirit, for
Yahweh searches all hearts, and understands every motivation of ones thoughts.  If you seek him, he will be found by
you, but if you abandon him, he will reject you permanently.
\v 10 Realize that  Yahweh has chosen you to build this temple as his sanctuary. Be strong, and do it."

\s5
\p
\v 11 Then David gave to Solomon his son the design of the porch
of the temple, its buildings, of the treasuries, and of the upper rooms, and of the
inner rooms, and  the room of the atonement lid.
\v 12 He gave him the plans he had for ennvisioned for the courts of the house of Yahweh, all the surrounding rooms, 
  the treasuries of the house of God, and the treasuries of the dedicated things.

\s5
\v 13 He gave him  regulations for the divisions of the priests  and the Levites, and for the assigned responsibilies for the service of the house of Yahweh, and for
all the vessels of service in the house of Yahweh.
\v 14 He gave him the weight of all the gold vessels for every kind of service, of all the silver vessels, for all vessels of every kind of service
\v 15 by weight, also for the candlesticks of gold, and for the lamps of gold, by weight for every candlestick and for the lamps, and for the candlesticks of silver by weight, for every candlestick and for the lamps, for the proper use of every candlestick,

\s5
\v 16 and the gold by weight for the tables of the bread of the presence, for every table, and silver for the tables of silver,
\v 17 and the meat forks, and the basins, and the cups, of pure gold; and for the golden bowls by weight for every bowl, and
for the silver bowls by weight for every bowl,

\s5
\v 18 and for the altar of incense refined gold by weight, and gold for the pattern of the
the cherubim, that spread out their wings, and covered the ark of the covenant of Yahweh.
\v 19 "All this,"  David said,  "I have put in writing as Yahweh directed me and gave me insight  regarding the blueprints."


\s5
\p
\v 20 And David said to Solomon his son, "Be strong and brave,  Do it! Do not be afraid or be anxious, for Yahweh God,
 my God, is with you. He will not leave you nor abandon you, until all the work for the service of the temple of Yahweh
is finished.
\v 21 Behold, here are the divisions of the priests and the Levites for all the service of the temple of God.  They will be with you
with all willing and skillful men to assist you in the work and to perform the service. The officials and
all the people are ready to follow  your commands."





\s5
\c 29
\p
\v 1 King David  said to the whole assembly, "Solomon my son, whom alone God has chosen, is still young and inexperienced, and
the task is great; for the palace is not for man, but for Yahweh God.
\v 2 Now because of my commitment to the temple of my God I donate the gold for the things of gold, the silver for the things of silver,  the brass for the things of brass, the iron for the things of iron,  wood for the things of wood; onyx stones, stones to be set, stones for inlaid work,  of various colors, all manner of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance.

\s5
\v 3 Now, because of my delight in the house of my God, I donate my personal  treasure of gold and silver to the house of my God, in addition to all that I have prepared for this holy temple, 
\v 4 three thousand talents of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the buildings,
\v 5 of gold for the things of gold, and of silver for the
things of silver, and for all kinds of work to done
by craftsmen.. Who else wants to contribute and to consecrate himself this day to Yahweh?
\s5
\p
\v 6 Then the leaders of the fathers’ houses, and the leaders of the tribes of Israel, and the commanders of thousands
and of hundreds, with the officials over the king’s work, offered willingly;
\v 7 They gave for the service of the house of God five thousand talents and ten thousand darics of gold,  ten
tfhousand talents of silver, eighteen thousand talents of silver, and a hundred thousand talents of iron.

\s5
\v 8 Those with  precious stones gave them to the treasury of the house of Yahweh, under the supervision
of Jehiel the Gershonite.
\v 9 The people rejoiced because of these freewilll offerings, because they contributed  wholeheartedly to Yahweh. King  David  also rejoiced greatly.

\s5
\p
\v 10 David blessed Jehovah before all the assembly; and David said, "Blessed are you, O Yahweh,  God of Israel
our father, forever and ever.
\v 11 Yours, O Yahweh, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in
the heavens and in the earth is yours; yours  is the kingdom, O Yahweh, and you are exalted as ruler over all.

\s5
\v 12 Both riches and honor come of you, and you rule over all. In your hand is power and might.  You posses the 
strength and might to make great and to give strength to all.
\v 13 Now therefore, our God, we thank you and praise your glorious name.

\s5
\v 14 But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly of this amount? Indeed all things come from you, and of your own we have simply given back to you.
\v 15 For we are strangers and travelers before you, like all our ancestors were. Our days on the earth are as a shadow, and
there is no abiding.

\s5
\v 16 O Yahweh our God, all this wealth that we have collected to build you a temple to honor your holy name comes from you, and
belongs to you.
\v 17 I know also, my God, that you examine  the heart, and have pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of my
heart I have willingly offered all these things,  and now I look with joy as your people, that are present here, offer
willingly to you.

\s5
\v 18 O Yahweh, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and  Israel, our fathers, keep this for ever in the thoughts of the
 minds of your people, and  direct their hearts  toward you.
\v 19 Give to Solomon my son a whole hearted desire, to keep your commandments, your testimonies, and your statutes, and to carry out all
these plans, and to build the palace, for which I have made provision."

\s5
\p
\v 20 David said to all the assembly," Now bless Yahweh your God." And all the assembly blessed Yahweh, the God of their
fathers, and bowed down their heads, and worshipped Yahweh, and before the king.
\v 21 And they sacrificed sacrifices to Yahweh, and offered burnt offerings to Yahweh, on the next day
a thousand bulls, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, with their drink-offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all
Israel.

\s5
\v 22 They ate  and drank before Yahweh on that day with great celebration.
\p And they made Solomon, the son of David, king a second time, and anointed him to Yahweh to be ruler.  Zadok  was to be
priest.
\v 23 Then Solomon sat on the throne of Yahweh, as king instead of David his father, and prospered, and all Israel obeyed him.

\s5
\v 24 All the leaders,  the warriers, and all of  of King David's sons gave allegience  to King Solomon.

\v 25 Yahweh magnified Solomon greatly before all Israel and bestowed upon him greaterl majesty than he had 
 on any king before him in Israel.

\s5
\p
\v 26  David, the son of Jesse, reigned over all Israel.
\v 27 The time that he reigned over Israel was forty years; seven years he reigned he in Hebron, and thirty three
years he reigned in Jerusalem.

\s5
\v 28 He died at a good old age, after enjoying  a long life, wealth  and honor.  Solomon his son succeeded him.
\v 29 King  David's accomplishments are written in the history of Samuel the prophet, in the
history of Nathan the prophet, and in the history of Gad the prophet,
\v 30 Recorded there are the facts  of  his reign, his accomplishments and the and the events that affected him,  Israel, and the
surrounding countries.
