And Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first, and was made chief.\s5\v 7 And David lived in the stronghold; therefore they called it the city of David.\v 8 And he built the city around from Millo and back to it. And Joab repaired the rest of the city.\v 9 And David became greater and greater, for Yahweh of Hosts was with him.\s5\p\v 10 Now these are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who showed themselves strong with him in his kingdom, togetherwith all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of Jehovah concerning Israel.\v 11 And this is the number of the mighty men whom David had: Jashobeam, the son of a Hachmonite, the chief of the thirty; helifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them at one time.\s5\v 12 And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighty men.\v 13 He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where was a plot of groundfull of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.\v 14 And they stood in the midst of the plot, and defended it, and killed the Philistines; and Jehovah saved them by a greatvictory.\s5\p\v 15 And three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the host of thePhilistines were encamped in the valley of Rephaim.\v 16 And David was then in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Beth-lehem.\v 17 And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me water to drink of the well of Beth-lehem, which is by the gate!\s5\v 18 And the three brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Beth-lehem, that was by thegate, and took it, and brought it to David: but David would not drink thereof, but poured it out to Jehovah,\v 19 and said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this: shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives injeopardy? for with the jeopardy of their lives they brought it. Therefore he would not drink it. These things did thethree mighty men.\s5\p\v 20 And Abishai, the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three; for he lifted up his spear against three hundred and killedthem, and had a name among the three.\v 21 Of the three, he was more honorable than the two, and was made their captain: howbeit he attained not to thefirst three.\s5\p\v 22 Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done mighty deeds, he killed the twosons of Ariel of Moab: he went down also and killed a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow.\v 23 And he killed an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits high; and in the Egyptianâs hand was a spear like a weaverâsbeam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptianâs hand, and killed him with his own spear.\s5\v 24 These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had a name among the three mighty men.\v 25 Behold, he was more honorable than the thirty, but he attained not to thefirst three: and David set him over his guard.\s5\p\v 26 Also the mighty men of the armies: Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Beth-lehem,\v 27 Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite,\v 28 Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abiezer the Anathothite,\v 29 Sibbecai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite,\s5\v 30 Maharai the Netophathite, Heled the son of Baanah the Netophathite,\v 31 Ithai the son of Ribai of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin, Benaiah the Pirathonite,\v 32 Hurai of the brooks of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite,\v 33 Azmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite,\s5\v 34 the sons of Hashem the Gizonite, Jonathan the son of Shagee the Hararite,\v 35 Ahiam the son of Sacar the Hararite, Eliphal the son of Ur,\v 36 Hepher the Mecherathite, Ahijah the Pelonite,\v 37 Hezro the Carmelite, Naarai the son of Ezbai,\s5\v 38 Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar the son of Hagri,\v 39 Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Berothite, the armorbearer of Joab the son of Zeruiah,\v 40 Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,\v 41 Uriah the Hittite, Zabad the son of Ahlai,\s5\v 42 Adina the son of Shiza the Reubenite, a chief of the Reubenites, and thirty with him,\v 43 Hanan the son of Maacah, and Joshaphat the Mithnite,\v 44 Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jeiel the sons of Hotham the Aroerite,\s5\v 45 Jediael the son of Shimri, and Joha his brother, the Tizite,\v 46 Eliel the Mahavite, and Jeribai, and Joshaviah, the sons of Elnaam, and Ithmah the Moabite,\v 47 Eliel, and Obed, and Jaasiel the Mezobaite.\s5\c 12\p\v 1 Now these are they that came to David to Ziklag, while he yet kept himself close because of Saul the son of Kish; and theywere among the mighty men, his helpers in war.\v 2 They were armed with bows, and could use both the right hand and the left in slinging stones and in shooting arrows fromthe bow: they were of Saulâs brethren of Benjamin.\s5\v 3 The chief was Ahiezer; then Joash, the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite, and Jeziel, and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth, andBeracah, and Jehu the Anathothite,\v 4 and Ishmaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man among the thirty, and over the thirty, and Jeremiah, and Jahaziel, and Johanan,and Jozabad the Gederathite,\s5\v 5 Eluzai, and Jerimoth, and Bealiah, and Shemariah, and Shephatiah the Haruphite,\v 6 Elkanah, and Isshiah, and Azarel, and Joezer, and Jashobeam, the Korahites,\v 7 and Joelah, and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham of Gedor.\s5\p\v 8 And of the Gadites there separated themselves to David to the stronghold in the wilderness, mighty men of valor, mentrained for war, that could handle shield and spear; whose faces were like the faces of lions, and they were as swift as theroes upon the mountains:\s5\v 9 Ezer the chief, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third,\v 10 Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth,\v 11 Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh,\v 12 Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth,\v 13 Jeremiah the tenth, Machbannai the eleventh.\s5\v 14 These of the sons of Gad were captains of the host: he that was least was equal to a hundred, and the greatest to athousand.\v 15 These are they that went over the Jordan in the first month, when it had overflowed all its banks; and they put to flightall them of the valleys, both toward the east and toward the west.\s5\p\v 16 And there came of the children of Benjamin and Judah to the stronghold to David.\v 17 And David went out to meet them, and answered and said to them, If you be come peaceably to me to help me, my heartshall be knit to you; but if you be come to betray me to mine adversaries, seeing there is no wrong in my hands, theGod of our fathers look thereon, and rebuke it.\s5\v 18 Then the Spirit came upon Amasai, who was chief of the thirty,and he said, Your are we, David, and on your side, you son of Jesse: peace, peace be to thee, and peace be to yourhelpers; for your God helps thee. Then David received them, and made them captains of the band.\s5\p\v 19 Of Manasseh also there fell away some to David, when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle: but they helpedthem not; for the lords of the Philistines upon advisement sent him away, saying, He will fall away to his master Saul to thejeopardy of our heads.\v 20 As he went to Ziklag, there fell to him of Manasseh, Adnah, and Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and Jozabad, andElihu, and Zillethai, captains of thousands that were of Manasseh.\s5\v 21 And they helped David against the band of rovers: for they were all mighty men of valor, and were captains in the host.\v 22 For from day to day men came to David to help him, until there was a great host, like the host of God.\s5\p\v 23 And these are the numbers of the heads of them that were armed for war, who came to David to Hebron, to turn the kingdomof Saul to him, according to the word of Jehovah.\v 24 The children of Judah that bare shield and spear were six thousand and eight hundred, armed for war.\v 25 Of the children of Simeon, mighty men of valor for the war, seven thousand and one hundred.\s5\v 26 Of the children of Levi four thousand and six hundred.\v 27 And Jehoiada was the leader of the house of Aaron; and with him were three thousand and seven hundred,\v 28 and Zadok, a young man mighty of valor, and of his fatherâs house twenty and two captains.\s5\v 29 And of the children of Benjamin, the brethren of Saul, three thousand: for hitherto the greatest part of them had kepttheir allegiance to the house of Saul.\v 30 And of the children of Ephraim twenty thousand and eight hundred, mighty men of valor, famous men in their fathersâhouses.\v 31 And of the half-tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand, who were mentioned by name, to come and make David king.\s5\v 32 And of the children of Issachar, men that had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do, the heads ofthem were two hundred; and all their brethren were at their commandment.\v 33 Of Zebulun, such as were able to go out in the host, that could set the battle in array, with all manner of instrumentsof war, fifty thousand, and that could order the battle array, andwere not of double heart.\s5\v 34 And of Naphtali a thousand captains, and with them with shield and spear thirty and seven thousand.\v 35 And of the Danites that could set the battle in array, twenty and eight thousand and six hundred.\s5\v 36 And of Asher, such as were able to go out in the host, that could set the battle in array, forty thousand.\v 37 And on the other side of the Jordan, of the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and of the half-tribe of Manasseh, with allmanner of instruments of war for the battle, a hundred and twenty thousand.\s5\p\v 38 All these, being men of war, that could order the battle array, came with a perfect heart to Hebron, to make David kingover all Israel: and all the rest also of Israel were of one heart to make David king.\v 39 And they were there with David three days, eating and drinking; for their brethren had made preparation for them.\v 40 Moreover they that were near to them, even as far as Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, brought bread onasses, and on camels, and on mules, and on oxen, food of meal, cakes of figs, and clusters of raisins, and wine, and oil,and oxen, and sheep in abundance: for there was joy in Israel.\s5\c 13\p\v 1 And David consulted with the captains of thousands and of hundreds, even with every leader.\v 2 And David said to all the assembly of Israel, If it seem good to you, and if it be of Jehovah our God, let us sendabroad every where to our brethren that are left in all the land of Israel, with whom the priests and Levites are in theircities that have suburbs, that they may gather themselves to us;\v 3 and let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we sought not to it in the days of Saul.\v 4 And all the assembly said that they would do so; for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.\s5\v 5 So David assembled all Israel together, from the Shihor the brookof Egypt even to the entrance of Hamath, to bring the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim.\v 6 And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, that is, to Kiriath-jearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring upfrom thence the ark of God Jehovah that sits above the cherubim, that is called by the Name.\s5\v 7 And they carried the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought itout of the house of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drove the cart.\v 8 And David and all Israel played before God with all their might, even with songs, and with harps, and with psalteries, andwith timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.\s5\p\v 9 And when they came to the threshing floor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled.\v 10 And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Uzza, and he struck him, because he put forth his hand to the ark; and therehe died before God.\v 11 And David was displeased, because Jehovah had broken forth upon Uzza: and he called that place Perez-uzza, to this day.\s5\v 12 And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God home to me?\v 13 So David removed not the ark to him into the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom theGittite.\v 14 And the ark of God remained with the family of Obed-edom in his house three months: and Jehovah blessed the house ofObed-edom, and all that he had.\s5\c 14\p\v 1 Then Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar-trees, and masons, and carpenters, to build him a house.\v 2 And David knew that Yahweh had established him as king over Israel; for his kingdom was exalted on high, for the sake of his people Israel.\s5\p\v 3 And David took more wives at Jerusalem; and David became the father of more sons and daughters.\v 4 And these are the names of the children whom he had in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,\v 5 Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet,\v 6 Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia,\v 7 Elishama, Beeliada, and Eliphelet.\s5\p\v 8 And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David. But  David heard of it, and went out against them.\v 9 Now the Philistines had come and made a raid in the valley of Rephaim.\s5\v 10 And David inquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? And will you deliver them into my hand? AndYahweh said to him, "Go up; for I will deliver them into your hand."\v 11 So they came up to Baal-perazim, and David struck them there; and David said, "God has broken mine enemies by my hand, like the bursting flood of waters." Therefore they called the name of that place Baal-perazim.\v 12 And they left their gods there; and David gave commandment, and they were burned with fire.\s5\p\v 13 And the Philistines yet again made a raid in the valley.\v 14 And David inquired again of God; and God said to him, "You shall not go up after them: turn away from them, and come upon them in front of the balsam-trees.\s5\v 15 And it shall be, when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam-trees, that then you shall go outto battle; for God has gone out before you to strike the army of the Philistines."\v 16 And David did as God commanded him: and they struck the army of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gezer.\v 17 And the fame of David went out into all lands; and Jehovah brought the fear of him upon all nations.\s5\c 15\p\v 1 And David made him houses in the city of David; and he prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched for it atent.\v 2 Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites: for them has Jehovah chosen to carry the ark of God,and to minister to him for ever.\v 3 And David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of Jehovah to its place, which he had prepared for it.\s5\v 4 And David gathered together the sons of Aaron, and the Levites:\v 5 of the sons of Kohath, Uriel the chief, and his brethren a hundred and twenty;\v 6 of the sons of Merari, Asaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred and twenty;\s5\v 7 of the sons of Gershom, Joel the chief, and his brethren a hundred and thirty;\v 8 of the sons of Elizaphan, Shemaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred;\v 9 of the sons of Hebron, Eliel the chief, and his brethren fourscore;\v 10 of the sons of Uzziel, Amminadab the chief, and his brethren a hundred and twelve.\s5\v 11 And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, andEliel, and Amminadab,\v 12 and said to them, You are the heads of the fathersâ housesof the Levites: sanctify yourselves, both you and your brethren, that you may bring up the ark of Jehovah, the God ofIsrael, to the place that I have prepared for it.\s5\v 13 For because you bare it not at the first, Jehovah our God made a breach upon us, for that we sought him notaccording to the ordinance.\v 14 So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of Jehovah, the God of Israel.\v 15 And the children of the Levites bare the ark of God upon their shoulders with the staves thereon, as Moses commandedaccording to the word of Jehovah.\s5\p\v 16 And David spoke to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren the singers, with instruments of music, lutesand harps and cymbals, sounding aloud and lifting up the voice with joy.\v 17 So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons ofMerari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah;\v 18 and with them their brethren of the second degree, Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni,Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, the doorkeepers.\s5\v 19 So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were appointed, with cymbals of brass to sound aloud;\v 20 and Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with lutesset to Alamoth;\v 21 and Mattithiah, and Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps set to the Sheminith, tolead.\s5\v 22 And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was over the song: he instructed about the song, because he was skilful.\v 23 And Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark.\v 24 And Shebaniah, and Joshaphat, and Nethanel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blowthe trumpets before the ark of God; and Obed-edom and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark.\s5\p\v 25 So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of Jehovahout of the house of Obed-edom with joy.\v 26 And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bare the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, that they sacrificed sevenbullocks and seven rams.\s5\v 27 And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that bare the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniahthe master of the song with the singers: and David had upon him an ephod of linen.\v 28 Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and withtrumpets, and with cymbals, sounding aloud with lutes and harps.\s5\p\v 29 And it came to pass, as the ark of the covenant of Jehovah came to the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saullooked out at the window, and saw king David dancing and playing; and she despised him in her heart.\s5\c 16\p\v 1 And they brought in the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it: and they offeredburnt offerings and peace-offerings before God.\v 2 And when David had made an end of offering the burnt offering and the peace-offerings, he blessed the people in the nameof Jehovah.\v 3 And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a portionof flesh, and a cake of raisins.\s5\p\v 4 And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark of Jehovah, and to celebrate and to thank and praiseJehovah, the God of Israel:\v 5 Asaph the chief, and second to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah,and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, with lutes and with harps; and Asaph with cymbals, sounding aloud;\v 6 and Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually, before the ark of the covenant of God.\s5\p\v 7 Then on that day did David first ordain to give thanks to Jehovah, by the hand of Asaph and his brethren.\q\v 8 O give thanks to Jehovah, call upon his name;\q Make known his doings among the peoples.\q\v 9 Sing to him, sing praises to him;\q Talk you of all his marvelous works.\s5\q\v 10 Glory you in his holy name;\q Let the heart of them rejoice that seek Jehovah.\q\v 11 Seek you Jehovah and his strength;\q Seek his face evermore.\s5\q\v 12 Remember his marvelous works that he has done,\q His wonders, and the judgments of his mouth,\q\v 13 O you seed of Israel his servant,\q You children of Jacob, his chosen ones.\q\v 14 He is Jehovah our God;\q His judgments are in all the earth.\s5\q\v 15 Remember his covenant for ever,\q The word which he commanded to a thousand generations,\q\v 16 The covenant which he made with Abraham,\q And his oath to Isaac,\q\v 17 And confirmed the same to Jacob for a statute,\q To Israel for an everlasting covenant,\q\v 18 Saying, To you will I give the land of Canaan,\q The lot of your inheritance;\s5\q\v 19 When you were but a few men in number,\q Yea, very few, and sojourners in it;\q\v 20 And they went about from nation to nation,\q And from one kingdom to another people.\q\v 21 He suffered no man to do them wrong;\q Yea, he reproved kings for their sakes,\q\v 22 Saying, Touch not mine anointed ones,\q And do my prophets no harm.\s5\q\v 23 Sing to Jehovah, all the earth;\q Show forth his salvation from day to day.\q\v 24 Declare his glory among the nations,\q His marvelous works among all the peoples.\s5\q\v 25 For great is Jehovah, and greatly to be praised:\q He also is to be feared above all gods.\q\v 26 For all the gods of the peoples are idols:\q But Jehovah made the heavens.\q\v 27 Honor and majesty are before him:\q Strength and gladness are in his place.\s5\q\v 28 Ascribe to Jehovah, you kindred of the peoples,\q Ascribe to Jehovah glory and strength;\q\v 29 Ascribe to Jehovah the glory due to his name:\q Bring an offering, and come before him;\q Worship Jehovah in holy array.\s5\q\v 30 Tremble before him, all the earth:\q The world also is established that it cannot be moved.\q\v 31 Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice;\q And let them say among the nations, Jehovah reigneth.\s5\q\v 32 Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof;\q Let the field exult, and all that is therein;\q\v 33 Then shall the trees of the wood sing for joy before Jehovah;\q For he comes to judge the earth.\s5\q\v 34 O give thanks to Jehovah; for he is good;\q For his lovingkindness endures for ever.\q\v 35 And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation,\q And gather us together and deliver us from the nations,\q To give thanks to your holy name,\q And to triumph in your praise.\s5\q\v 36 Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel,\q From everlasting even to everlasting.\m And all the people said, Amen, and praised Jehovah.\s5\p\v 37 So he left there, before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, Asaph and his brethren, to minister before the arkcontinually, as every dayâs work required;\v 38 and Obed-edom with their brethren, threescore and eight; Obed-edom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to be doorkeepers;\v 39 and Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of Jehovah in the high place that was atGibeon,\s5\v 40 to offer burnt offerings to Jehovah upon the altar of burnt offering continually morning and evening, even according toall that is written in the law of Jehovah, which he commanded to Israel;\v 41 and with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were chosen, who were mentioned by name, to give thanks to Jehovah,because his lovingkindness endures for ever;\s5\v 42 and with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should sound aloud, andwith instruments for the songs of God; and the sons of Jeduthun to be at the gate.\v 43 And all the people departed every man to his house: and David returned to bless his house.\s5\c 17\p\v 1 And it came to pass, when David lived in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in a house ofcedar, but the ark of the covenant of Jehovah lives under curtains.\v 2 And Nathan said to David, Do all that is in your heart; for God is with thee.\s5\v 3 And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying,\v 4 Go and tell David my servant, Thus says Jehovah, You shall not build me a house to dwell in:\v 5 for I have not lived in a house since the day that I brought up Israel, to this day, but have gone from tent to tent,and from one tabernacle to another.\v 6 In all places wherein I have walked with all Israel, did I speak a word with any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded tobe shepherd of my people, saying, "Why have you not built me a house of cedar?"\s5\v 7 Now therefore thus shall you say to my servant David, "Thus says Jehovah of hosts, 'I took you from the pasture, fromfollowing the sheep, that you should be prince over my people Israel.\v 8 And I have been with you wherever youwent, and have cut off all your enemies from before you. And I willmake you a name, like the name of the great ones of the earth.\s5\v 9 And I will appoint a place for my people Israel and will plant them, so that they may dwell in their own place and be moved no more. And wicked men will not wear them out any more, as before,\v 10 and as from the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel. And I will subdue all your enemies.Moreover I tell you that Yahweh will build you a house.\s5\v 11 And it shall come to pass, when your days are fulfilled that you must go to be with your fathers, I will set up your seed after thee, who will be of your sons, and I will establish his kingdom.\v 12 He will build me a house, and I will establish his throne for ever.\s5\v 13 I will a father to him, and he will be my son: and I will not take my lovingkindness away from him, as I took it from him that was before thee;\v 14 but I will settle him in my house and in my kingdom for ever; and his throne shall be established for ever.'"\v 15 According to all these words, and according to all this vision, Nathan spoke to David.\s5\p\v 16 Then David the king went in, and sat before Jehovah; and he said, Who am I, O Jehovah God, and what is my house, thatyou have brought me thus far?\v 17 And this was a small thing in your eyes, O God; but you have spoken of your servantâs house for a great while to come,and have regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O Jehovah God.\v 18 What can David say yet more to you concerning the honor which is done to your servant? for you know yourservant.\s5\v 19 O Jehovah, for your servantâs sake, and according to your own heart, have you wrought all this greatness, to make knownall these great things.\v 20 O Jehovah, there is none like thee, neither is there any God besides thee, according to all that we have heard with ourears.\v 21 And what one nation in the earth is like your people Israel, whom God went to redeem to himself for a people, to makeyou a name by great and terrible things, in driving out nations from before your people, whom you redeemest out of Egypt?\s5\v 22 For your people Israel did you make your own people for ever; and you, Jehovah, became their God.\v 23 And now, O Jehovah, let the word that you have spoken concerning your servant, and concerning his house, be establishedfor ever, and do as you have spoken.\v 24 And let your name be established and magnified for ever, saying, Jehovah of hosts is the God of Israel, even a God toIsrael: and the house of David your servant is established before thee.\s5\v 25 For you, O my God, have revealed to your servant that you will build him a house: therefore has your servant foundin his heart to pray before thee.\v 26 And now, O Jehovah, you are God, and have promised this good thing to your servant:\v 27 and now it has pleased you to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue for ever before you: for thou, OJehovah, have blessed, and it is blessed for ever.\s5\c 18\p\v 1 And after this it came to pass, that David struck the Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and its towns out of the hand of the Philistines.\v 2 And he struck Moab; and the Moabites became servants to David, and brought tribute.\s5\p\v 3 And David struck Hadarezer king of Zobah to Hamath, as he went to establish his dominion by the river Euphrates.\v 4 And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen; and David hamstrung all the chariot horses, but reserved enough of them for a hundred chariots.\s5\p\v 5 And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succor Hadarezer king of Zobah, David struck two and twentythousand men of the Syrians .\v 6 Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus; and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought tribute.And Yahweh gave victory to David wherever he went.\s5\v 7 And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.\v 8 And from Tibhath and from Cun, cities of Hadarezer, David took very much brass, wherewith Solomon made the brazen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.\s5\p\v 9 And when Toi king of Hamath heard that David had struck all the host of Hadadezer king of Zobah,\v 10 he sent Hadoram his son to king David, to salute him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer andstruck him (for Hadadezer had wars with Toi); and he had withhim all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass.\v 11 These also did king David dedicate to Yahweh, with the silver and the gold that he carried away from all the nations;from Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalek.\s5\p\v 12 Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah struck of the Edomites in the Valley of Salt eighteen thousand.\v 13 And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became servants to David. And Jehovah gave victory to Davidwherever he went.\s5\p\v 14 And David reigned over all Israel; and he executed justice and righteousness to all his people.\v 15 And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder;\v 16 and Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar, were priests; and Shavsha was scribe;\v 17 and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David were chief about theking.\s5\c 19\p\v 1 And it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his stead.\v 2 And David said, I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me. So David sentmessengers to comfort him concerning his father. And Davidâs servants came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, tocomfort him.\v 3 But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest you that David does honor your father, in that he hassent comforters to you? are not his servants come to you to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land?\s5\v 4 So Hanun took Davidâs servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, andsent them away.\v 5 Then there went certain persons, and told David how the men were served. And he sent to meet them; for the men weregreatly ashamed. And the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.\s5\p\v 6 And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent athousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Aram-maacah, and out of Zobah.\v 7 So they hired them thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of Maacah and his people, who came and encamped beforeMedeba. And the children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle.\s5\v 8 And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men.\v 9 And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the gate of the city: and the kings that were come wereby themselves in the field.\s5\p\v 10 Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel, andput them in array against the Syrians.\v 11 And the rest of the people he committed into the hand of Abishai his brother; and they put themselves in array againstthe children of Ammon.\s5\v 12 And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then you shall help me; but if the children of Ammon be too strong forthee, then I will help thee.\v 13 Be of good courage, and let us play the man for our people, and for the cities of our God: and Jehovah do that whichseems him good.\s5\v 14 So Joab and the people that were with him drew near before the Syrians to the battle; and they fled before him.\v 15 And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and enteredinto the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.\s5\p\v 16 And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syriansthat were beyond the River, with Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer at their head.\v 17 And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel together, and passed over the Jordan, and came upon them, and set thebattle in array against them. So when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him.\s5\v 18 And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David killed of the Syriansthe men of seven thousand chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the host.\v 19 And when the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they made peace with David, andserved him: neither would the Syrians help the children of Ammon any more.\s5\c 20\p\v 1 And it came to pass, at the time of the return of the year, at the time when kings go outto battle, that Joab led forth the army, and wasted the country of the children of Ammon, and came and besiegedRabbah. But David tarried at Jerusalem. And Joab struck Rabbah, and overthrew it.\s5\v 2 And David took the crown of their king from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and in it there were preciousstones; and it was set upon Davidâs head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city, exceeding much.\v 3 And he brought forth the people that were therein, and cut them with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes. And thus did David do to all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.\s5\p\v 4 And it came to pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines: then Sibbecai the Hushathite killedSippai, of the sons of the giant; and they were subdued.\v 5 And there was again war with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair killed Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite,the staff of whose spear was like a weaverâs beam.\s5\v 6 And there was again war at Gath, where was a man of great stature, whose fingers and toes were four and twenty, sixon each hand, and six on each foot; and he also was born to the giant.\v 7 And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea Davidâs brother killed him.\v 8 These were born to the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.\s5\c 21\p\v 1 And Satan stood up against Israel, and moved David to number Israel.\v 2 And David said to Joab and to the princes of the people, Go, number Israel from Beer-sheba even to Dan; and bring me word,that I may know the sum of them.\v 3 And Joab said, Yahweh make his people a hundred times as many as they are: but, my lord the king, are they not all mylordâs servants? why does my lord require this thing? why will he be a cause of guilt to Israel?\s5\v 4 Nevertheless the kingâs word prevailed against Joab. Wherefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came toJerusalem.\v 5 And Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people to David. And all they of Israel were a thousand thousand and ahundred thousand men that drew sword: and Judah was four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword.\s5\v 6 But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them; for the kingâs word was abominable to Joab.\v 7 And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he struck Israel.\v 8 And David said to God, I have sinned greatly, in that I have done this thing: but now put away, I beseech thee, theiniquity of your servant; for I have done very foolishly.\s5\p\v 9 And Yahweh spoke to Gad, Davidâs seer, saying,\v 10 Go and speak to David, saying, Thus says Yahweh, I offer you three things: choose you one of them, that I may do itto thee.\s5\v 11 So Gad came to David, and said to him, Thus says Yahweh, Take which you wilt:\v 12 either three years of famine; or three months to be consumed before your foes, while the sword of your enemies overtakeththee; or else three days the sword of Jehovah, even pestilence in the land, and the angel of Yahweh destroying throughout allthe borders of Israel. Now therefore consider what answer I shall return to him that sent me.\s5\v 13 And David said to Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall, I pray, into the hand of Yahweh; for very great are hismercies: and let me not fall into the hand of man.\v 14 So Yahweh sent a pestilence upon Israel; and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men.\v 15 And God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was about to destroy, Yahweh beheld, and he repented himof the evil, and said to the destroying angel, It is enough; now stay your hand. And the angel of Yahweh was standing by thethreshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.\s5\v 16 And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of Yahweh standing between earth and heaven, having a drawn sword in hishand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces.\v 17 And David said to God, Is it not I that commanded the people to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and donevery wickedly; but these sheep, what have they done? let your hand, I pray thee, O Yahweh my God, be against me, and against myfatherâs house; but not against your people, that they should be plagued.\s5\p\v 18 Then the angel of Yahweh commanded Gad to say to David, that David should go up, and rear an altar to Yahweh in thethreshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.\v 19 And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spoke in the name of Yahweh.\v 20 And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons that were with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshingwheat.\s5\v 21 And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshing-floor, and bowed himself to Davidwith his face to the ground.\v 22 Then David said to Ornan, Give me the place of this threshing-floor, that I may build thereon an altar to Yahweh: forthe full price shall you give it me, that the plague may be stayed from the people.\s5\v 23 And Ornan said to David, Take it to thee, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes: lo, I giveyou the oxen for burnt-offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the grain offering; Igive it all.\v 24 And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it for the full price: for I will not take that which is yourfor Yahweh, nor offer a burnt offering without cost.\s5\v 25 So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight.\v 26 And David built there an altar to Yahweh, and offered burnt offerings and peace-offerings, and called upon Jehovah;and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt-offering.\v 27 And Yahweh commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into the sheath thereof.\s5\p\v 28 At that time, when David saw that Yahweh had answered him in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, then hesacrificed there.\v 29 For the tabernacle of Yahweh, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt-offering, were at that time inthe high place at Gibeon.\v 30 But David could not go before it to inquire of God; for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of Yahweh.\s5\c 22\p\v 1 Then David said, This is the house of Jehovah God, and this is the altar of burnt offering for Israel.\p\v 2 And David commanded to gather together the sojourners that were in the land of Israel; and he set masons to hew wroughtstones to build the house of God.\s5\v 3 And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the couplings; and brass inabundance without weight;\v 4 and cedar-trees without number: for the Sidonians and they of Tyre brought cedar-trees in abundance to David.\v 5 And David said, Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house that is to be builded for Jehovah must be exceedingmagnificent, of fame and of glory throughout all countries: I will therefore make preparation for it. So David preparedabundantly before his death.\s5\p\v 6 Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build a house for Jehovah, the God of Israel.\v 7 And David said to Solomon his son, As for me, it was in my heart to build a house to the name of Jehovah my God.\v 8 But the word of Jehovah came to me, saying, You have shed blood abundantly, and have made great wars: you shall notbuild a house to my name, because you have shed much blood upon the earth in my sight.\s5\v 9 Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies roundabout; for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness to Israel in his days:\v 10 he shall build a house for my name; and he shall be my son, and I will be his father; and I will establish the throne ofhis kingdom over Israel for ever.\s5\v 11 Now, my son, Jehovah be with thee; and prosper thou, and build the house of Jehovah your God, as he has spoken concerningthee.\v 12 Only Jehovah give you discretion and understanding, and give you charge concerning Israel; that so you may keep thelaw of Jehovah your God.\v 13 Then shall you prosper, if you observe to do the statutes and the ordinances which Jehovah charged Moses withconcerning Israel: be strong, and of good courage; fear not, neither be dismayed.\s5\v 14 Now, behold, in my affliction I have prepared for the house of Jehovah a hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousandthousand talents of silver, and of brass and iron without weight; for it is in abundance: timber also and stone have Iprepared; and you may add thereto.\s5\v 15 Moreover there are workmen with you in abundance, hewers and workers of stone and timber, and all men that are skillfulin every manner of work:\v 16 of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, there is no number. Arise and be doing, and Jehovah be with thee.\s5\p\v 17 David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son,saying,\v 18 Is not Jehovah your God with you? and has he not given you rest on every side? for he has delivered the inhabitants ofthe land into my hand; and the land is subdued before Jehovah, and before his people.\v 19 Now set your heart and your soul to seek after Jehovah your God; arise therefore, and build you the sanctuary of JehovahGod, to bring the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and the holy vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the nameof Jehovah.\s5\c 23\p\v 1 Now David was old and full of days; and he made Solomon his son king over Israel.\v 2 And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites.\v 3 And the Levites were numbered from thirty years old and upward: and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirtyand eight thousand.\s5\v 4 Of these, twenty and four thousand were to oversee the work of the house of Jehovah; and six thousand were officers andjudges;\v 5 and four thousand were doorkeepers; and four thousand praised Jehovah with the instruments which I made,said David, to praise therewith.\v 6 And David divided them into courses according to the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.\s5\p\v 7 Of the Gershonites: Ladan and Shimei.\v 8 The sons of Ladan: Jehiel the chief, and Zetham, and Joel, three.\v 9 The sons of Shimei: Shelomoth, and Haziel, and Haran, three. These were the heads of the fathersâhouses of Ladan.\s5\v 10 And the sons of Shimei: Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei.\v 11 And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and Beriah had not many sons; therefore they became a fathersâhouse in one reckoning.\s5\p\v 12 The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.\v 13 The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses; and Aaron was separated, that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and hissons, for ever, to burn incense before Jehovah, to minister to him, and to bless in his name, for ever.\v 14 But as for Moses the man of God, his sons were named among the tribe of Levi.\s5\v 15 The sons of Moses: Gershom and Eliezer.\v 16 The sons of Gershom: Shebuel the chief.\v 17 And the sons of Eliezer were: Rehabiah the chief; and Eliezer had no other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many.\v 18 The sons of Izhar: Shelomith the chief.\s5\v 19 The sons of Hebron: Jeriah the chief, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.\v 20 The sons of Uzziel: Micah the chief, and Isshiah the second.\s5\p\v 21 The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Mahli: Eleazar and Kish.\v 22 And Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters only: and their brethren the sons of Kish took themto wife.\v 23 The sons of Mushi: Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three.\s5\p\v 24 These were the sons of Levi after their fathersâ houses, even the heads of the fathersâhouses of those of them that were counted, in the number of names by their polls, who did the work for the service ofthe house of Jehovah, from twenty years old and upward.\v 25 For David said, Jehovah, the God of Israel, has given rest to his people; and he lives in Jerusalem for ever:\v 26 and also the Levites shall no more have need to carry the tabernacle and all the vessels of it for the service thereof.\s5\v 27 For by the last words of David the sons of Levi were numbered, from twenty years old and upward.\v 28 For their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of Jehovah, in the courts, and in thechambers, and in the purifying of all holy things, even the work of the service of the house of God;\v 29 for the bread of the presence also, and for the fine flour for a grain offering, whether of unleavened wafers, or of that which isbaked in the pan, or of that which is soaked, and for all manner of measure and size;\s5\v 30 and to stand every morning to thank and praise Jehovah, and likewise at even;\v 31 and to offer all burnt offerings to Jehovah, on the sabbaths, on the new moons, and on the set feasts, in numberaccording to the ordinance concerning them, continually before Jehovah;\s5\v 32 and that they should keep the charge of the tent of meeting, and the charge of the holy place, and the charge of the sonsof Aaron their brethren, for the service of the house of Jehovah.\s5\c 24\p\v 1 And the courses of the sons of Aaron were these. The sons of Aaron: Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.\v 2 But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no children: therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priestâsoffice.\v 3 And David with Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, divided them according to theirordering in their service.\s5\v 4 And there were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar; andthus were they divided: of the sons of Eleazar there were sixteen, heads of fathersâ houses; and of the sons ofIthamar, according to their fathersâ houses, eight.\v 5 Thus were they divided by lot, one sort with another; for there were princes of the sanctuary, and princes of God, both ofthe sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar.\s5\v 6 And Shemaiah the son of Nethanel the scribe, who was of the Levites, wrote them in the presence of the king, and theprinces, and Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and the heads of the fathersâhouses of the priests and of the Levites; one fathersâ house being taken for Eleazar, and one taken for Ithamar.\s5\p\v 7 Now the first lot came forth to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah,\v 8 the third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim,\v 9 the fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin,\v 10 the seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah,\s5\v 11 the ninth to Jeshua, the tenth to Shecaniah,\v 12 the eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim,\v 13 the thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jeshebeab,\v 14 the fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer,\s5\v 15 the seventeenth to Hezir, the eighteenth to Happizzez,\v 16 the nineteenth to Pethahiah, the twentieth to Jehezkel,\v 17 the one and twentieth to Jachin, the two and twentieth to Gamul,\v 18 the three and twentieth to Delaiah, the four and twentieth to Maaziah.\s5\v 19 This was the ordering of them in their service, to come into the house of Jehovah according to the ordinancegiven to them by Aaron their father, as Jehovah, the God of Israel, had commanded him.\s5\p\v 20 And of the rest of the sons of Levi: of the sons of Amram, Shubael; of the sons of Shubael, Jehdeiah.\v 21 Of Rehabiah: of the sons of Rehabiah, Isshiah the chief.\v 22 Of the Izharites, Shelomoth; of the sons of Shelomoth, Jahath.\s5\v 23 And the sons of Hebron: Jeriah the chief, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, Jekameam thefourth.\v 24 The sons of Uzziel, Micah; of the sons of Micah, Shamir.\v 25 The brother of Micah, Isshiah; of the sons of Isshiah, Zechariah.\s5\v 26 The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi; the sons of Jaaziah: Beno.\v 27 The sons of Merari: of Jaaziah, Beno, and Shoham, and Zaccur, and Ibri.\v 28 Of Mahli: Eleazar, who had no sons.\s5\v 29 Of Kish; the sons of Kish: Jerahmeel.\v 30 And the sons of Mushi: Mahli, and Eder, and Jerimoth.

These were the captains of the tribes of Israel.\s5\v 23 But David took not the number of them from twenty years old and under, because Jehovah had said he would increase Israellike to the stars of heaven.\v 24 Joab the son of Zeruiah began to number, but finished not; and there came wrath for this upon Israel; neither was thenumber put into the account in the chronicles of king David.\s5\p\v 25 And over the kingâs treasures was Azmaveth the son of Adiel: and over the treasures in the fields, in the cities, and inthe villages, and in the castles, was Jonathan the son of Uzziah:\v 26 And over them that did the work of the field for tillage of the ground was Ezri the son of Chelub:\v 27 and over the vineyards was Shimei the Ramathite: and over the increase of the vineyards for the wine-cellars was Zabdithe Shiphmite:\s5\v 28 and over the olive-trees and the sycomore-trees that were in the lowland was Baal-hanan the Gederite: and over thecellars of oil was Joash:\v 29 and over the herds that fed in Sharon was Shitrai the Sharonite: and over the herds that were in the valleys was Shaphatthe son of Adlai:\s5\v 30 and over the camels was Obil the Ishmaelite: and over the asses was Jehdeiah the Meronothite: and over the flocks wasJaziz the Hagrite.\v 31 All these were the rulers of the substance which was king Davidâs.\s5\p\v 32 Also Jonathan, Davidâs uncle, was a counsellor, a man of understanding, and a scribe: and Jehiel the son of Hachmoni waswith the kingâs sons:\v 33 And Ahithophel was the kingâs counsellor: and Hushai the Archite was the kingâs friend:\v 34 and after Ahithophel was Jehoiada the son of Benaiah, and Abiathar: and the captain of the kingâs host was Joab.\s5\c 28\p\v 1 And David assembled all the princes of Israel, the princes of the tribes, and the captains of the companies that servedthe king by course, and the captains of thousands, and the captains of hundreds, and the rulers over all the substance andpossessions of the king and of his sons, with the officers, and the mighty men, even all the mighty men of valor, toJerusalem.\s5\v 2 Then David the king stood up upon his feet, and said, Hear me, my brethren, and my people: as for me, it was in my heartto build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and for the footstool of our God; and I had made ready for thebuilding.\v 3 But God said to me, You shall not build a house for my name, because you are a man of war, and have shed blood.\s5\v 4 Howbeit Jehovah, the God of Israel, chose me out of all the house of my father to be king over Israel for ever: for hehas chosen Judah to be prince; and in the house of Judah, the house of my father; and among the sons of my father he tookpleasure in me to make me king over all Israel;\v 5 And of all my sons (for Jehovah has given me many sons), he has chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of thekingdom of Jehovah over Israel.\s5\v 6 And he said to me, Solomon your son, he shall build my house and my courts; for I have chosen him to be my son, and Iwill be his father.\v 7 And I will establish his kingdom for ever, if he be constant to do my commandments and mine ordinances, as at this day.\s5\v 8 Now therefore, in the sight of all Israel, the assembly of Jehovah, and in the audience of our God, observe and seek outall the commandments of Jehovah your God; that you may possess this good land, and leave it for an inheritance to your childrenafter you for ever.\s5\p\v 9 And you, Solomon my son, know you the God of your father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind; forJehovah searcheth all hearts, and understands all the imaginations of the youghts: if you seek him, he will be found ofyou; but if you forsake him, he will cast you off for ever.\v 10 Take heed now; for Jehovah has chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary: be strong, and do it.\s5\p\v 11 Then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porchof the temple, and of the houses thereof, and of the treasuries thereof, and of the upper rooms thereof, and of theinner chambers thereof, and of the place of the atonement lid;\v 12 and the pattern of all that he had by the Spirit, for the courts of the house of Jehovah, and for all the chambers roundabout, for the treasuries of the house of God, and for the treasuries of the dedicated things;\s5\v 13 also for the courses of the priests and the Levites, and for all the work of the service of the house of Jehovah, and forall the vessels of service in the house of Jehovah;\v 14 of gold by weight for the vessels of gold, for all vessels of every kind of service;of silver for all the vessels of silver by weight, for all vessels of every kind of service;\v 15 by weight also for the candlesticks of gold, and for the lamps thereof, of gold, by weight for every candlestick and forthe lamps thereof;

and gold for the pattern of the chariot,even the cherubim, that spread out their wings, and covered the ark of the covenant of Jehovah.\v 19 All this, said David, have I been made to understand in writing from the hand of Jehovah, even all the works ofthis pattern.\s5\p\v 20 And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and of good courage, and do it: fear not, nor be dismayed; for Jehovah God,even my God, is with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee, until all the work for the service of the house of Jehovahbe finished.\v 21 And, behold, there are the courses of the priests and the Levites, for all the service of the house of God: and thereshall be with you in all manner of work every willing man that has skill, for any manner of service: also the captains andall the people will be wholly at your commandment.\s5\c 29\p\v 1 And David the king said to all the assembly, Solomon my son, whom alone God has chosen, is yet young and tender, andthe work is great; for the palace is not for man, but for Jehovah God.\v 2 Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold for thethings of gold, and the silver for the things of silver, and the brass for thethings of brass, the iron for the things of iron, and wood for thethings of wood; onyx stones, and stones to be set, stones for inlaid work, and of various colors, and allmanner of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance.\s5\v 3 Moreover also, because I have set my affection on the house of my God, seeing that I have a treasure of mine own of goldand silver, I give it to the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house,\v 4 even three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, wherewith tooverlay the walls of the houses;\v 5 of gold for the things of gold, and of silver for thethings of silver, and for all manner of work to be madeby the hands of artificers. Who then offers willingly to consecrate himself this day to Jehovah?\s5\p\v 6 Then the princes of the fathersâ houses, and the princes of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousandsand of hundreds, with the rulers over the kingâs work, offered willingly;\v 7 and they gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand darics, and of silver tenthousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents, and of iron a hundred thousand talents.\s5\v 8 And they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the treasure of the house of Jehovah, under the handof Jehiel the Gershonite.\v 9 Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly, because with a perfect heart they offered willingly to Jehovah:and David the king also rejoiced with great joy.\s5\p\v 10 Wherefore David blessed Jehovah before all the assembly; and David said, Blessed be thou, O Jehovah, the God of Israelour father, for ever and ever.\v 11 Thine, O Jehovah, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is inthe heavens and in the eareh is your; your is the kingdom, O Jehovah, and you are exalted as head above all.\s5\v 12 Both riches and honor come of thee, and you rule over all; and in your hand is power and might; and in your hand it isto make great, and to give strength to all.\v 13 Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise your glorious name.\s5\v 14 But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all things come ofthee, and of your own have we given thee.\v 15 For we are strangers before thee, and sojourners, as all our fathers were: our days on the earth are as a shadow, andthere is no abiding.\s5\v 16 O Jehovah our God, all this store that we have prepared to build you a house for your holy name comes of your hand, andis all your own.\v 17 I know also, my God, that you triest the heart, and have pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of myheart I have willingly offered all these things: and now have I seen with joy your people, that are present here, offerwillingly to thee.\s5\v 18 O Jehovah, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this for ever in the imagination of thethoughts of the heart of your people, and prepare their heart to thee;\v 19 and give to Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep your commandments, your testimonies, and your statutes, and to do allthese things, and to build the palace, for which I have made provision.\s5\p\v 20 And David said to all the assembly, Now bless Jehovah your God. And all the assembly blessed Jehovah, the God of theirfathers, and bowed down their heads, and worshipped Jehovah, and the king.\v 21 And they sacrificed sacrifices to Jehovah, and offered burnt offerings to Jehovah, on the morrow after that day, evena thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, with their drink-offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for allIsrael,\s5\v 22 and did eat and drink before Jehovah on that day with great gladness.\p And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed him to Jehovah to be prince, and Zadok to bepriest.\v 23 Then Solomon sat on the throne of Jehovah as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.\s5\v 24 And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise of king David, submitted themselves to Solomon theking.\v 25 And Jehovah magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had notbeen on any king before him in Israel.\s5\p\v 26 Now David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.\v 27 And the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years; seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and threeyears reigned he in Jerusalem.\s5\v 28 And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honor: and Solomon his son reigned in his stead.\v 29 Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are written in the history of Samuel the seer, and in thehistory of Nathan the prophet, and in the history of Gad the seer,\v 30 with all his reign and his might, and the times that went over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of thecountries.
