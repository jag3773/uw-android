Yea, I and my fatherâs house have sinned:\v 7 we have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the ordinances, whichyou commanded your servant Moses.\s5\v 8 Remember, I beseech thee, the word that you commanded your servant Moses, saying, If you trespass, I will scatter youabroad among the peoples:\v 9 but if you return to me, and keep my commandments and do them, though your outcasts were in the uttermost part of theheavens, yet will I gather them from thence, and will bring them to the place that I have chosen, to cause my name to dwellthere.\s5\v 10 Now these are your servants and your people, whom you have redeemed by your great power, and by your strong hand.\v 11 O Lord, I beseech thee, let now your ear be attentive to the prayer of your servant, and to the prayer of your servants,who delight to fear your name; and prosper, I pray thee, your servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man.\p Now I was cupbearer to the king.\s5\c 2\nb\v 1 And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, when wine was before him, that Itook up the wine, and gave it to the king. Now I had not been beforetime sad in his presence.\v 2 And the king said to me, Why is your countenance sad, seeing you are not sick? this is nothing else but sorrow of heare.Then I was very sore afraid.\s5\v 3 And I said to the king, Let the king live for ever: why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of myfathersâ sepulchres, lies waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire?\s5\v 4 Then the king said to me, For what do you make request? So I prayed to the God of heaven.\v 5 And I said to the king, If it please the king, and if your servant have found favor in your sight, that you would sendme to Judah, to the city of my fathersâ sepulchres, that I may build it.\v 6 And the king said to me (the queen also sitting by him), For how long shall your journey be? and when will you return?So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time.\s5\v 7 Moreover I said to the king, If it please the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the River, that theymay let me pass through till I come to Judah;\v 8 and a letter to Asaph the keeper of the kingâs forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of thecastle which pertains to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall enter into. And the kinggranted me, according to the good hand of my God upon me.\s5\p\v 9 Then I came to the governors beyond the River, and gave them the kingâs letters. Now the king had sent with me captains ofthe army and horsemen.\v 10 And when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly, for thatthere was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel.\s5\v 11 So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.\v 12 And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither told I any man what my God put into my heart to do forJerusalem; neither was there any beast with me, save the beast that I rode upon.\s5\v 13 And I went out by night by the valley gate, even toward the jackalâs well, and to the dung gate, and viewed the walls ofJerusalem, which were broken down, and the gates thereof were consumed with fire.\v 14 Then I went on to the fountain gate and to the kingâs pool: but there was no place for the beast that was under me topass.\s5\v 15 Then went I up in the night by the brook, and viewed the wall; and I turned back, and entered by the valley gate, and soreturned.\v 16 And the rulers knew not whither I went, or what I did; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, norto the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work.\s5\p\v 17 Then said I to them, You see the evil case that we are in, how Jerusalem lies waste, and the gates thereof are burnedwith fire: come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we be no more a reproach.\v 18 And I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me, as also of the kingâs words that he had spoken to me. Andthey said, Let us rise up and build. So they strengthened their hands for the goodwork.\s5\v 19 But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they laughed usto scorn, and despised us, and said, What is this thing that you do? will you rebel against the king?\v 20 Then answered I them, and said to them, The God of heaven, he will prosper us; therefore we his servants will arise andbuild: but you have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem.\s5\c 3\p\v 1 Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brethren the priests, and they builded the sheep gate; they sanctified it,and set up the doors of it; even to the tower of Hammeah they sanctified it, to the tower of Hananel.\v 2 And next to him builded the men of Jericho.

And he that sounded the trumpet was by me.\s5\v 19 And I said to the nobles, and to the rulers and to the rest of the people, The work is great and large, and we areseparated upon the wall, one far from another:\v 20 in what place soever you hear the sound of the trumpet, resort you there to us; our God will fight for us.\s5\p\v 21 So we wrought in the work: and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared.\v 22 Likewise at the same time said I to the people, Let every one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in thenight they may be a guard to us, and may labor in the day.\v 23 So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard that followed me, none of us put off ourclothes, every one went with his weapon to the water.\s5\c 5\p\v 1 Then there arose a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the Jews.\v 2 For there were that said, We, our sons and our daughters, are many: let us get grain, that we may eat and live.\v 3 Some also there were that said, We are mortgaging our fields, and our vineyards, and our houses: let us get grain, becauseof the dearth.\s5\v 4 There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the kingâs tributeupon our fields and our vineyards.\v 5 Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children: and, lo, we bring into bondage our sonsand our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought into bondagealready: neither is it in our power to help it; for other men have our fields and our vineyards.\s5\p\v 6 And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.\v 7 Then I consulted with myself, and contended with the nobles and the rulers, and said to them, You exact usury, every oneof his brother. And I held a great assembly against them.\v 8 And I said to them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the Jews, that were sold to the nations; and wouldyou even sell your brethren, and should they be sold to us? Then held they their peace, and found never a word.\s5\v 9 Also I said, The thing that you do is not good: ought you not to walk in the fear of our God, because of the reproach of thenations our enemies?\v 10 And I likewise, my brethren and my servants, do lend them money and grain. I pray you, let us leave off this usury.\v 11 Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their fields, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also thehundredth part of the money, and of the grain, the new wine, and the oil, that you exact of them.\s5\v 12 Then said they, We will restore them, and will require nothing of them; so will we do, even as you sayest. Then I calledthe priests, and took an oath of them, that they would do according to this promise.\v 13 Also I shook out my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his house, and from his labor, that performeth notthis promise; even thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the assembly said, Amen, and praised Jehovah. And the people didaccording to this promise.\s5\p\v 14 Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even tothe two and thirties year of Artaxerxes the king, that is, twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the breadof the governor.\v 15 But the former governors that were before me were chargeable to the people, and took of them bread and wine, besidesforty shekels of silver; yea, even their servants bare rule over the people: but so did not I, because of the fear of God.\s5\v 16 Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought we any land: and all my servants were gathered thereto the work.\v 17 Moreover there were at my table, of the Jews and the rulers, a hundred and fifty men, besides those that came to usfrom among the nations that were round about us.\s5\v 18 Now that which was prepared for one day was one ox and six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in tendays store of all sorts of wine: yet for all this I demanded not the bread of the governor, because the bondage was heavy uponthis people.\v 19 Remember to me, O my God, for good, all that I have done for this people.\s5\c 6\p\v 1 Now it came to pass, when it was reported to Sanballat and Tobiah, and to Geshem the Arabian, and to the rest of ourenemies, that I had builded the wall, and that there was no breach left therein (though even to that time I had not set upthe doors in the gates),\v 2 that Sanballat and Geshem sent to me saying, Come, let us meet together inone of the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief.\s5\v 3 And I sent messengers to them, saying, I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease,while I leave it, and come down to you?\v 4 And they sent to me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner.\s5\v 5 Then sent Sanballat his servant to me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand,\v 6 wherein was written, It is reported among the nations, and Gashmu says it, that you and the Jews think to rebel; forwhich cause you are building the wall: and you would be their king, according to these words.\s5\v 7 And you have also appointed prophets to preach of you at Jerusalem, saying, There is a king in Judah: and now shall itbe reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together.\s5\v 8 Then I sent to him, saying, There are no such things done as you sayest, but you feignest them out of your own heart.\v 9 For they all would have made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it be not done. But now,O God, strengthen you my hands.\s5\p\v 10 And I went to the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us meettogether in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to kill thee; yea,in the night will they come to kill thee.\v 11 And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there, that, being such as I, would go into the temple to save hislife? I will not go in.\s5\v 12 And I discerned, and, lo, God had not sent him; but he pronounced this prophecy against me: and Tobiah and Sanballat hadhired him.\v 13 For this cause was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and that they might have matter for an evilreport, that they might reproach me.\v 14 Remember, O my God, Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and also the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest ofthe prophets, that would have put me in fear.\s5\p\v 15 So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day ofthe month Elul, in fifty and two days.\v 16 And it came to pass, when all our enemies heard thereof, that all the nations that were about us feared, andwere much cast down in their own eyes; for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God.\s5\v 17 Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah, andthe letters of Tobiah came to them.\v 18 For there were many in Judah sworn to him, because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah the son of Arah; and his sonJehohanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah to wife.\v 19 Also they spoke of his good deeds before me, and reported my words to him.And Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.\s5\c 7\p\v 1 Now it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and the porters and the singers and the Leviteswere appointed,\v 2 that I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the governor of the castle, charge over Jerusalem; for he was a faithful man,and feared God above many.\s5\v 3 And I said to them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot; and while they standon guard, let them shut the doors, and bar you them: and appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one inhis watch, and every one to be over against his house.\v 4 Now the city was wide and large; but the people were few therein, and the houses were not builded.\s5\p\v 5 And my God put into my heart to gather together the nobles, and the rulers, and the people, that they might be reckoned bygenealogy. And I found the book of the genealogy of them that came up at the first, and I found written therein:\s5\v 6 These are the children of the province, that went up out of the captivity of those that had been carried away, whomNebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away, and that returned to Jerusalem and to Judah, every one to his city;\v 7 who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum,Baanah.\s5\p The number of the men of the people of Israel:\v 8 The children of Parosh, two thousand a hundred and seventy and two.\v 9 The children of Shephatiah, three hundred seventy and two.\v 10 The children of Arah, six hundred fifty and two.\s5\v 11 The children of Pahath-moab, of the children of Jeshua and Joab, two thousand and eight hundredand eighteen.\v 12 The children of Elam, a thousand two hundred fifty and four.\v 13 The children of Zattu, eight hundred forty and five.\v 14 The children of Zaccai, seven hundred and threescore.\s5\v 15 The children of Binnui, six hundred forty and eight.\v 16 The children of Bebai, six hundred twenty and eight.\v 17 The children of Azgad, two thousand three hundred twenty and two.\v 18 The children of Adonikam, six hundred threescore and seven.\s5\v 19 The children of Bigvai, two thousand threescore and seven.\v 20 The children of Adin, six hundred fifty and five.\v 21 The children of Ater, of Hezekiah, ninety and eight.\v 22 The children of Hashum, three hundred twenty and eight.\s5\v 23 The children of Bezai, three hundred twenty and four.\v 24 The children of Hariph, a hundred and twelve.\v 25 The children of Gibeon, ninety and five.\v 26 The men of Bethlehem and Netophah, a hundred fourscore and eight.\s5\v 27 The men of Anathoth, a hundred twenty and eight.\v 28 The men of Beth-azmaveth, forty and two.\v 29 The men of Kiriath-jearim, Chephirah, and Beeroth, seven hundred forty and three.\v 30 The men of Ramah and Geba, six hundred twenty and one.\s5\v 31 The men of Michmas, a hundred and twenty and two.\v 32 The men of Beth-el and Ai, a hundred twenty and three.\v 33 The men of the other Nebo, fifty and two.\v 34 The children of the other Elam, a thousand two hundred fifty and four.\s5\v 35 The children of Harim, three hundred and twenty.\v 36 The children of Jericho, three hundred forty and five.\v 37 The children of Lod, Hadid, and Ono, seven hundred twenty and one.\v 38 The children of Senaah, three thousand nine hundred and thirty.\s5\p\v 39 The priests: The children of Jedaiah, of the house of Jeshua, nine hundred seventy and three.\v 40 The children of Immer, a thousand fifty and two.\v 41 The children of Pashhur, a thousand two hundred forty and seven.\v 42 The children of Harim, a thousand and seventeen.\s5\p\v 43 The Levites: the children of Jeshua, of Kadmiel, of the children of Hodevah, seventy and four.\v 44 The singers: the children of Asaph, a hundred forty and eight.\v 45 The porters: the children of Shallum, the children of Ater, the children of Talmon, the children of Akkub, the childrenof Hatita, the children of Shobai, a hundred thirty and eight.\s5\p\v 46 The Nethinim: the children of Ziha, the children of Hasupha, the children of Tabbaoth,\v 47 the children of Keros, the children of Sia, the children of Padon,\v 48 the children of Lebana, the children of Hagaba, the children of Salmai,\v 49 the children of Hanan, the children of Giddel, the children of Gahar,\s5\v 50 the children of Reaiah, the children of Rezin, the children of Nekoda,\v 51 the children of Gazzam, the children of Uzza, the children of Paseah.\v 52 The children of Besai, the children of Meunim, the children of Nephushesim,\s5\v 53 the children of Bakbuk, the children of Hakupha, the children of Harhur,\v 54 the children of Bazlith, the children of Mehida, the children of Harsha,\v 55 the children of Barkos, the children of Sisera, the children of Temah,\v 56 the children of Neziah, the children of Hatipha.\s5\p\v 57 The children of Solomonâs servants: the children of Sotai, the children of Sophereth, the children of Perida,\v 58 the children of Jaala, the children of Darkon, the children of Giddel,\v 59 the children of Shephatiah, the children of Hattil, the children of Pochereth-hazzebaim, the children of Amon.\v 60 All the Nethinim, and the children of Solomonâs servants, were three hundred ninety and two.\s5\p\v 61 And these were they that went up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer; but they could not show theirfathersâ houses, nor their seed, whether they were of Israel:\v 62 The children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children of Nekoda, six hundred forty and two.\v 63 And of the priests: the children of Hobaiah, the children of Hakkoz, the children of Barzillai, who took a wife of thedaughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and was called after their name.\s5\v 64 These sought their register among those that were reckoned by genealogy, but it was not found: therefore werethey deemed polluted and put from the priesthood.\v 65 And the governor said to them, that they should not eat of the most holy things, till there stood up a priest with Urimand Thummim.\s5\p\v 66 The whole assembly together was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore,\v 67 besides their male servants and their maid-servants, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven: andthey had two hundred forty and five singing men and singing women.\s5\v 68 Their horses were seven hundred thirty and six;

The governor gave to the treasury athousand darics of gold, fifty basins, five hundred and thirty priestsâ garments.\v 71 And some of the heads of fathersâ houses gave into the treasury of the work twenty thousand darics of gold, andtwo thousand and two hundred pounds of silver.\v 72 And that which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand darics of gold, and two thousand pounds of silver, andthreescore and seven priestsâ garments.\s5\p\v 73 So the priests, and the Levites, and the porters, and the singers, and some of the people, and the Nethinim, and allIsrael, lived in their cities.\p And when the seventh month was come, the children of Israel were in their cities.\s5\c 8\nb\v 1 And all the people gathered themselves together as one man into the broad place that was before the water gate; and theyspoke to Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, which Jehovah had commanded to Israel.\v 2 And Ezra the priest brought the law before the assembly, both men and women, and all that could hear with understanding,upon the first day of the seventh month.\v 3 And he read therein before the broad place that was before the water gate from early morning until midday, in the presenceof the men and the women, and of those that could understand; and the ears of all the people wereattentive to the book of the law.\s5\v 4 And Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood, which they had made for the purpose; and beside him stood Mattithiah, andShema, and Anaiah, and Uriah, and Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, on his right hand; and on his left hand, Pedaiah, and Mishael, andMalchijah, and Hashum, and Hashbaddanah, Zechariah, and Meshullam.\v 5 And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people (for he was above all the people); and when he opened it, all thepeople stood up.\s5\v 6 And Ezra blessed Jehovah, the great God; and all the people answered, Amen, Amen, with the lifting up of their hands: andthey bowed their heads, and worshipped Jehovah with their faces to the ground.\v 7 Also Jeshua, and Bani, and Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan,Pelaiah, and the Levites, caused the people to understand the law: and the people stood in their place.\v 8 And they read in the book, in the law of God, distinctly; and they gave the sense, so that they understood the reading.\s5\p\v 9 And Nehemiah, who was the governor, and Ezra the priest the scribe, and the Levites that taught the people, said to allthe people, This day is holy to Jehovah your God; mourn not, nor weep. For all the people wept, when they heard the words ofthe law.\v 10 Then he said to them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions to him for whom nothing isprepared; for this day is holy to our Lord: neither be you grieved; for the joy of Jehovah is your strength.\s5\v 11 So the Levites stilled all the people, saying, Hold your peace, for the day is holy; neither be you grieved.\v 12 And all the people went their way to eat, and to drink, and to send portions, and to make great mirth, because they hadunderstood the words that were declared to them.\s5\p\v 13 And on the second day were gathered together the heads of fathersâhouses of all the people, the priests, and the Levites, to Ezra the scribe, even to give attention to the words ofthe law.\v 14 And they found written in the law, how that Jehovah had commanded by Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell inbooths in the feast of the seventh month;\v 15 and that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying, Go forth to the mount, andfetch olive branches, and branches of wild olive, and myrtle branches, and palm branches, and branches of thick trees, to makebooths, as it is written.\s5\v 16 So the people went forth, and brought them, and made themselves booths, every one upon the roof of his house, and intheir courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the broad place of the water gate, and in the broad place of thegate of Ephraim.\v 17 And all the assembly of them that were come again out of the captivity made booths, and lived in the booths: for sincethe days of Jeshua the son of Nun to that day had not the children of Israel done so. And there was very great gladness.\s5\v 18 Also day by day, from the first day to the last day, he read in the book of the law of God. And they kept the feastseven days; and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly, according to the ordinance.\s5\c 9\p\v 1 Now in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children of Israel were assembled with fasting, and with sackcloth, andearth upon them.\v 2 And the seed of Israel separated themselves from all foreigners, and stood and confessed their sins, and the iniquities oftheir fathers.\s5\v 3 And they stood up in their place, and read in the book of the law of Jehovah their God a fourth part of the day; andanother fourth part they confessed, and worshipped Jehovah their God.\v 4 Then stood up upon the stairs of the Levites, Jeshua, and Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani,and Chenani, and cried with a loud voice to Jehovah their God.\s5\p\v 5 Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah, said, Stand up and bless Jehovah your God from everlasting to everlasting; and blessed be your glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise.\v 6 You are Jehovah, even you alone; you have made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the eareh and all things that are thereon, the seas and all that is in them, and you preservest them all; and the host of heaven worships thee.\s5\v 7 You are Jehovah the God, who did choose Abram, and brought him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees, and gave him thename of Abraham,\v 8 and found his heart faithful before thee, and made a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanite, theHittite, the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite, and the Girgashite, to give it to his seed, and have performed yourwords; for you are righteous.\s5\p\v 9 And you saw the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heard their cry by the Red Sea,\v 10 and showedst signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, and on all his servants, and on all the people of his land; for you knewthat they dealt proudly against them, and did get you a name, as it is this day.\s5\v 11 And you did divide the sea before them, so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and theirpursuers you did cast into the depths, as a stone into the mighty waters.\s5\v 12 Moreover in a pillar of cloud you led them by day; and in a pillar of fire by night, to give them light in the waywherein they should go.\v 13 You came down also upon mount Sinai, and spoke with them from heaven, and gave them right ordinances and truelaws, good statutes and commandments,\s5\v 14 and made known to them your holy sabbath, and commanded them commandments, and statutes, and a law, by Moses yourservant,\v 15 and gave them bread from heaven for their hunger, and brought forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst,and commanded them that they should go in to possess the land which you had sworn to give them.\s5\p\v 16 But they and our fathers dealt proudly, and hardened their neck, and listened not to your commandments,\v 17 and refused to obey, neither were mindful of your wonders that you did among them, but hardened their neck, and intheir rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage. But you are a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slowto anger, and abundant in lovingkindness, and forsookest them not.\s5\v 18 Yea, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This is your God that brought you up out of Egypt, and had wroughtgreat provocations;\v 19 yet you in your manifold mercies forsookest them not in the wilderness: the pillar of cloud departed not from over themby day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by night, to show them light, and the way wherein they should go.\s5\v 20 You gave also your good Spirit to instruct them, and withheldest not your manna from their mouth, and gave them waterfor their thirst.\v 21 Yea, forty years did you sustain them in the wilderness,and they lacked nothing; their clothes waxed not old, and their feet swelled not.\s5\v 22 Moreover you gave them kingdoms and peoples, which you did allot after their portions: so they possessed the landof Sihon, even the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan.\s5\v 23 Their children also multipliedst you as the stars of heaven, and brought them into the land concerning which youdid say to their fathers, that they should go in to possess it.\v 24 So the children went in and possessed the land, and you subduedst before them the inhabitants of the land, theCanaanites, and gave them into their hands, with their kings, and the peoples of the land, that they might do with them asthey would.\s5\v 25 And they took fortified cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses full of all good things, cisterns hewn out,vineyards, and oliveyards, and fruit-trees in abundance: so they did eat, and were filled, and became fat, and delightedthemselves in your great goodness.\s5\p\v 26 Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against thee, and cast your law behind their back, and killed your prophetsthat testified against them to turn them again to thee, and they wrought great provocations.\v 27 Therefore you delivered them into the hand of their adversaries, who distressed them: and in the time of theirtrouble, when they cried to thee, you heard from heaven; and according to your manifold mercies you gave them saviourswho saved them out of the hand of their adversaries.\s5\v 28 But after they had rest, they did evil again before thee; therefore left you them in the hand of their enemies, sothat they had the dominion over them: yet when they returned, and cried to thee, you heard from heaven; and many timesdid you deliver them according to your mercies,\v 29 and testifiedst against them, that you might bring them again to your law. Yet they dealt proudly, and listened notto your commandments, but sinned against your ordinances (which if a man do, he shall live in them), and withdrew theshoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear.\s5\v 30 Yet many years did you bear with them, and testifiedst against them by your Spirit through your prophets: yet would theynot give ear: therefore gave you them into the hand of the peoples of the lands.\v 31 Nevertheless in your manifold mercies you did not make a full end of them, nor forsake them; for you are a graciousand merciful God.\s5\p\v 32 Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the terrible God, who keep covenant and lovingkindness, let not all the travail seem little before thee, that has come upon us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all your people, since the time of the kings of Assyria to this day.\v 33 Howbeit you are just in all that is come upon us; for you have dealt truly, but we have done wickedly;\v 34 neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept your law, nor listened to your commandments and your testimonies wherewith you did testify against them.\s5\v 35 For they have not served you in their kingdom, and in your great goodness that you gave them, and in the large and fat land which you gave before them, neither turned they from their wicked works.\s5\v 36 Behold, we are servants this day, and as for the land that you gave to our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof, behold, we are servants in it.\v 37 And it yieldeth much increase to the kings whom you have set over us because of our sins: also they have power over our bodies, and over our cattle, at their pleasure, and we are in great distress.\s5\v 38 And yet for all this we make a sure covenant, and write it; and our princes, our Levites, and our priests, seal to it.\s5\c 10\p\v 1 Now those that sealed were: Nehemiah the governor, the son of Hacaliah, and Zedekiah,\v 2 Seraiah, Azariah, Jeremiah,\v 3 Pashhur, Amariah, Malchijah,\s5\v 4 Hattush, Shebaniah, Malluch,\v 5 Harim, Meremoth, Obadiah,\v 6 Daniel, Ginnethon, Baruch,\v 7 Meshullam, Abijah, Mijamin,\v 8 Maaziah, Bilgai, Shemaiah;

and that we would forego the seventh year, and the exaction of every debt.\s5\p\v 32 Also we made ordinances for us, to charge ourselves yearly with the third part of a shekel for the service of the houseof our God;\v 33 for the bread of the presence, and for the continual grain offering, and for the continual burnt-offering, for the sabbaths, for thenew moons, for the set feasts, and for the holy things, and for the sin-offerings to make atonement for Israel, and for all thework of the house of our God.\s5\v 34 And we cast lots, the priests, the Levites, and the people, for the wood-offering, to bring it into the house of our God, according to our fathersâ houses, at times appointed, year by year, to burn upon the altar of Jehovah our God, as it is written in the law;\v 35 and to bring the first fruits of our ground, and the first fruits of all fruit of all manner of trees, year by year, to the house of Jehovah;\v 36 also the firstborn of our sons, and of our cattle, as it is written in the law, and the firstlings of our herds and of our flocks, to bring to the house of our God, to the priests that minister in the house of our God;\s5\v 37 and that we should bring the first fruits of our dough, and our heave-offerings, and the fruit of all manner of trees,the new wine and the oil, to the priests, to the chambers of the house of our God; and the tithes of our ground to theLevites; for they, the Levites, take the tithes in all the cities of our tillage.\v 38 And the priest the son of Aaron shall be with the Levites, when the Levites take tithes: and the Levites shall bring upthe tithe of the tithes to the house of our God, to the chambers, into the treasure-house.\s5\v 39 For the children of Israel and the children of Levi shall bring the presented offering of the grain, of the new wine, and ofthe oil, to the chambers, where are the vessels of the sanctuary, and the priests that minister, and the porters, and thesingers: and we will not forsake the house of our God.\s5\c 11\p\v 1 And the princes of the people lived in Jerusalem: the rest of the people also cast lots, to bring one of ten to dwell inJerusalem the holy city, and nine parts in the other cities.\v 2 And the people blessed all the men that willingly offered themselves to dwell in Jerusalem.\s5\p\v 3 Now these are the chiefs of the province that lived in Jerusalem: but in the cities of Judah lived every one in hispossession in their cities, to wit, Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the Nethinim, and the children ofSolomonâs servants.\v 4 And in Jerusalem lived certain of the children of Judah, and of the children of Benjamin.

These were the chiefs of the priests and of their brethren in the days of Jeshua.\s5\p\v 8 Moreover the Levites: Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah,and Mattaniah, who was over the thanksgiving, he and his brethren.\v 9 Also Bakbukiah and Unno, their brethren, were over against them according to their offices.\s5\v 10 And Jeshua became the father of Joiakim, and Joiakim became the father of Eliashib, and Eliashib became the father of Joiada,\v 11 and Joiada became the father of Jonathan, and Jonathan became the father of Jaddua.\s5\p\v 12 And in the days of Joiakim were priests, heads of fathersâhouses: of Seraiah, Meraiah; of Jeremiah, Hananiah;\v 13 of Ezra, Meshullam; of Amariah, Jehohanan;\v 14 of Malluchi, Jonathan; of Shebaniah, Joseph;\s5\v 15 of Harim, Adna; of Meraioth, Helkai;\v 16 of Iddo, Zechariah; of Ginnethon, Meshullam;\v 17 of Abijah, Zichri; of Miniamin, of Moadiah, Piltai;\v 18 of Bilgah, Shammua; of Shemaiah, Jehonathan;\v 19 and of Joiarib, Mattenai; of Jedaiah, Uzzi;\v 20 of Sallai, Kallai; of Amok, Eber;\v 21 of Hilkiah, Hashabiah; of Jedaiah, Nethanel.\s5\p\v 22 As for the Levites, in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, and Johanan, and Jaddua, there were recorded the heads of fathersâhouses; also the priests, in the reign of Darius the Persian.\v 23 The sons of Levi, heads of fathersâ houses, were written in the book of the chronicles, even until the days ofJohanan the son of Eliashib.\s5\v 24 And the chiefs of the Levites: Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel, with their brethren over againstthem, to praise and give thanks, according to the commandment of David the man of God, watch next to watch.\v 25 Mattaniah, and Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, Akkub, were porters keeping the watch at the store-houses of thegates.\v 26 These were in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor, and ofEzra the priest the scribe.\s5\p\v 27 And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites out of all their places, to bring them toJerusalem, to keep the dedication with gladness, both with thanksgivings, and with singing, with cymbals, psalteries, and withharps.\v 28 And the sons of the singers gathered themselves together, both out of the plain round about Jerusalem, and from thevillages of the Netophathites;\s5\v 29 also from Beth-gilgal, and out of the fields of Geba and Azmaveth: for the singers had builded them villages round aboutJerusalem.\v 30 And the priests and the Levites purified themselves; and they purified the people, and the gates, and the wall.\s5\p\v 31 Then I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall, and appointed two great companies that gave thanks and went inprocession; whereof one went on the right hand upon the wall toward the dung gate:\s5\v 32 and after them went Hoshaiah, and half of the princes of Judah,\v 33 and Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam,\v 34 Judah, and Benjamin, and Shemaiah, and Jeremiah,\v 35 and certain of the priestsâ sons with trumpets: Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah,the son of Micaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph;\s5\v 36 and his brethren, Shemaiah, and Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, and Judah, Hanani, with the musical instrumentsof David the man of God; and Ezra the scribe was before them.\v 37 And by the fountain gate, and straight before them, they went up by the stairs of the city of David, at the ascent of thewall, above the house of David, even to the water gate eastward.\s5\p\v 38 And the other company of them that gave thanks went to meet them, and I after them, with the half of the people, upon thewall, above the tower of the furnaces, even to the broad wall,\v 39 and above the gate of Ephraim, and by the old gate, and by the fish gate, and the tower of Hananel, and the tower ofHammeah, even to the sheep gate: and they stood still in the gate of the guard.\s5\v 40 So stood the two companies of them that gave thanks in the house of God, and I, and the half of the rulers with me;\v 41 and the priests, Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with trumpets;\v 42 and Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, and Eleazar, and Uzzi, and Jehohanan, and Malchijah, and Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sangloud, with Jezrahiah their overseer.\s5\v 43 And they offered great sacrifices that day, and rejoiced; for God had made them rejoice with great joy; and the womenalso and the children rejoiced: so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off.\s5\p\v 44 And on that day were men appointed over the chambers for the treasures, for the heave-offerings, for the first-fruits,and for the tithes, to gather into them, according to the fields of the cities, the portions appointed by the law for thepriests and Levites: for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites that waited.\v 45 And they kept the charge of their God, and the charge of the purification, andso did the singers and the porters, according to the commandment of David, and of Solomon his son.\s5\v 46 For in the days of David and Asaph of old there was a chief of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving toGod.\v 47 And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the porters,as every day required: and they set apart that which was for the Levites; and the Levites set apartthat which was for the sons of Aaron.\s5\c 13\p\v 1 On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people; and therein was found written, that an Ammoniteand a Moabite should not enter into the assembly of God for ever,\v 2 because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with water, but hired Balaam against them, to curse them:howbeit our God turned the curse into a blessing.\v 3 And it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude.\s5\p\v 4 Now before this, Eliashib the priest, who was appointed over the chambers of the house of our God, being allied toTobiah,\v 5 had prepared for him a great chamber, where aforetime they laid the meal-offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels, andthe tithes of the grain, the new wine, and the oil, which were given by commandment to the Levites, and the singers, and theporters; and the heave-offerings for the priests.\s5\v 6 But in all this time I was not at Jerusalem; for in the two and thirties year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon Iwent to the king: and after certain days asked I leave of the king,\v 7 and I came to Jerusalem, and understood the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in thecourts of the house of God.\s5\v 8 And it grieved me sore: therefore I cast forth all the household stuff of Tobiah out of the chamber.\v 9 Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers: and there brought I again the vessels of the house of God, with themeal-offerings and the frankincense.\s5\p\v 10 And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them; so that the Levites and the singers, that didthe work, were fled every one to his field.\v 11 Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why is the house of God forsaken? And I gathered them together, and set them in their place.\s5\v 12 Then brought all Judah the tithe of the grain and the new wine and the oil to the treasuries.\v 13 And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: andnext to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah; for they were counted faithful, and their business was todistribute to their brethren.\v 14 Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and forthe observances thereof.\s5\p\v 15 In those days saw I in Judah some men treading wine presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading assestherewith; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on thesabbath day: and I testified against them in the day wherein they sold victuals.\s5\v 16 There lived men of Tyre also therein, who brought in fish, and all manner of wares, and sold on the sabbath to thechildren of Judah, and in Jerusalem.\v 17 Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said to them, What evil thing is this that you do, and profane thesabbath day?\v 18 Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yout you bring more wrathupon Israel by profaning the sabbath.\s5\p\v 19 And it came to pass that, when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the doorsshould be shut, and commanded that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and some of my servants set I over thegates, that there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day.\v 20 So the merchants and sellers of all kind of wares lodged without Jerusalem once or twice.\s5\v 21 Then I testified against them, and said to them, Why lodge you about the wall? if you do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth came they no more on the sabbath.\v 22 And I commanded the Levites that they should purify themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day. Remember to me, O my God, this also, and spare me according to the greatness of your lovingkindness.\s5\p\v 23 In those days also saw I the Jews that had married women of Ashdod, of Ammon,and of Moab:\v 24 and their children spoke half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jewsâ language, but according to thelanguage of each people.\s5\v 25 And I contended with them, and cursed them, and struck certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear byGod, saying, You shall not give your daughters to their sons, nor take their daughters for your sons, or foryourselves.\v 26 Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among many nations was there no king like him, and he was belovedof his God, and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did foreign women cause to sin.\v 27 Shall we then listen to you to do all this great evil, to trespass against our God in marrying foreign women?\s5\p\v 28 And one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite: therefore Ichased him from me.\v 29 Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of theLevites.\s5\p\v 30 Thus cleansed I them from all foreigners, and appointed charges for the priests and for the Levites, every one in hiswork;\v 31 and for the wood-offering, at times appointed, and for the first-fruits. Remember me, O my God, for good.
