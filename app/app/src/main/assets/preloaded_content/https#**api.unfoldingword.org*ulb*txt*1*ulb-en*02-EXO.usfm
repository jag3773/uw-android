\s5
\c 1
\p
\v 1 These are the names of the sons of Israel who came into Egypt, each with his household,  with Jacob:
\v 2 Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,
\v 3 Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,
\v 4 Dan, Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.
\v 5 All of the descendants of Jacob were seventy. Joseph was in Egypt already.

\s5
\v 6 Then Joseph, all his brothers, and all that generation died.
\v 7 The Israelites were fruitful, increased greatly, multiplied, and became extremely strong; the land was filled with them.

\s5
\p
\v 8 Then a new king arose over Egypt, who did not know Joseph.
\v 9 He said to his people, "Look at the Israelite people; they are more numerous and stronger than we are.
\v 10 Come, let us deal wisely with them.  Otherwise they will continue to multiply, and if war breaks out, they will join our enemies, fight against us, and leave the land."

\s5
\v 11 Therefore they put taskmasters over them to oppress them with hard labor. They built the storage cities for Pharaoh, Pithom and Rameses.
\v 12 But the more they oppressed them, the more the Israelites multiplied and spread. So the Egyptians began to dread the Israelites.

\s5
\v 13 So the Egyptians made the Israelites work rigorously.
\v 14 They made their lives bitter with hard service, with mortar and brick, and with all kind of service in the field. All their service was required with rigor.

\s5
\p
\v 15 Then the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, the name of the one was Shiphrah and the other Puah.
\v 16 He said, "When you assist the Hebrew women on the birthstool, observe at the delivery.  If it is male, then you must kill him; but if it is female, then she may live."
\v 17 But the midwives feared God and did not do as the king of Egypt ordered them, but they let the male babies live.

\s5
\v 18 The king of Egypt summoned the midwives and said to them, "Why have you done this and let the male babies live?"
\v 19 The midwives answered to Pharaoh, "The Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women; they are vigorous and are delivered before the midwife comes to them."

\s5
\v 20 God took care of the midwives. The people multiplied and became very strong.
\v 21 Because the midwives feared God, he made them households.
\v 22 Pharaoh ordered all his people, "Every male that is born you must throw into the river, and every female you may let live."





\s5
\c 2
\p
\v 1 A man of the house of Levi married a daughter of Levi.
\v 2 The woman became pregnant and gave birth to a son. When she saw him that he was a healthy son, she hid him three months.

\s5
\v 3 But when she could no longer hide him, she took a papyrus basket and sealed it with bitumen and pitch. Then she put the child in it and put it among the reeds along the side of the river.
\v 4 His sister stood at a distance to see what would happen to him.

\s5
\v 5 The daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river while her attendants walked along by the river-side. She saw the basket among the reeds and sent her attendant to get it.
\v 6 When she opened it, she saw the child. Behold, the baby was crying. She had compassion on him and said, "This is one of the Hebrews’ children."

\s5
\v 7 Then his sister said to Pharaoh’s daughter, "Shall I go and find you a Hebrew women to nurse the child for you?"
\v 8 Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, "Go." The young girl went and got the child’s mother.

\s5
\v 9 Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, "Take this child and nurse him for me, and I will pay you wages." So the woman took the child and nursed him.
\v 10 When the child grew older, she brought him to Pharaoh’s daughter, and he became her son. She named him Moses, saying, "Because I drew him from the water."

\s5
\p
\v 11 When Moses had grown up, he went out to his people and observed their hard labor. He saw an Egyptian striking a Hebrew, one of his own people.
\v 12 He looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no one there, he killed the Egyptian and hid his body in the sand.

\s5
\v 13 He went out the next day, and, behold, two Hebrew men were fighting. He said to him who was in the wrong, "Why do you strike your companion?"
\v 14 But he said, "Who made you a prince and a judge over us? Are you planning to kill me as you killed the Egyptian?"  Then Moses was afraid, and said, "Surely what I did has become known."

\s5
\v 15 Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to kill Moses. But Moses fled from Pharaoh and stayed in the land of Midian. There he sat down by a well.
\p
\v 16 Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters. They came and drew water, and they filled the troughs to water their father’s flock.
\v 17 The shepherds came and drove them away, but Moses stood up and helped them and watered their flock.

\s5
\v 18 And when the daughters came to Reuel their father, he said, "Why are home so early today?"
\v 19 They said, "An Egyptian rescued us from the shepherds. He even drew water for us and watered the flock."
\v 20 He said to his daughters, "So where is he? Why did you leave the man? Call him so that he may eat a meal with us."

\s5
\v 21 Moses agreed to stay with the man, who also gave Zipporah his daughter to Moses in marriage.
\v 22 She bore a son, and Moses called his name Gershom, saying, "I have been a resident in a foreign land."

\s5
\p
\v 23 During that long period of time, the king of Egypt died. The Israelites groaned because of the slave labor.  They cried out, and their cry came up to God because of their bondage.
\v 24 When God heard their groaning, God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.
\v 25 God saw the Israelites and God understood.





\s5
\c 3
\p
\v 1 Now Moses was shepherding the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian. He led the flock to the far side of the wilderness and came to the mountain of God, to Horeb.
\v 2 The angel of Yahweh appeared to him in a flame of fire in a bush.  Moses looked, and behold, the bush was burning with fire, but the bush was not consumed.
\v 3 Moses said, "I will turn aside and see this great sight, why the bush is not burned up."

\s5
\v 4 When Yahweh saw that he turned aside to look, God called to him out of the bush and said, "Moses, Moses." Moses said, "Here I am."
\v 5 God said, "Do not come any closer!  Take off your shoes from your feet, for the place where you are  standing is holy ground."
\v 6 He added, "I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." Then Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look at God.

\s5
\v 7 Yahweh said, "I have certainly seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt. I have heard their cry because of their taskmasters, for I know their suffering.
\v 8  I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land to a good and large land, to a land flowing with milk and honey; to the region of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites.

\s5
\v 9 And now the cries of the people of Israel have come to me. Moreover, I have seen the oppression by the Egyptians.
\v 10 Now therefore I will send you to Pharaoh so that you may bring my people, the Israelites, out of Egypt."

\s5
\v 11 But Moses said to God, "Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh and that I should bring the Israelites out of Egypt?"
\v 12 God replied, "I will certainly be with you. This shall be a sign to you that I have sent you. When you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall worship God on this mountain."

\s5
\p
\v 13 Moses said to God, "When I go to the Israelites and tell them, 'The God of your fathers has sent me to you,' and they say to me, 'What is his name?' what shall I say to them?"
\v 14 God said to Moses, "I AM THAT I AM." God said, You must say to the Israelites, 'I AM has sent me to you.'"
\v 15 God also said to Moses, "You must say to Israelites, 'Yahweh, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you.' This is my name forever, and this is my memorial to all generations.

\s5
\v 16 Go and gather the elders of Israel together. Say to them, 'Yahweh, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, has appeared to me, saying, 'I have indeed observed you and have seen what has been done to you in Egypt.
\v 17 I have promised to bring you up out of the oppression in Egypt to the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites,  the Hivites, and the Jebusites to a land flowing with milk and honey.'
\v 18 They will listen to you. You and the elders of Israel must go to the king of Egypt, and you must tell him, 'Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us. So now let us go three days’ journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the Lord our God.'

\s5
\v 19 But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go, except if his hand is forced.
\v 20 I will put forth my hand and attack the Egyptians with all my wonders which I will do among them, and after that he will let you go.
\v 21 I will grant this people favor with the Egyptians, so when you depart, you shall not go empty-handed.
\v 22 Every woman shall ask her neighbor and of any woman staying in her house for jewels of silver and gold and for clothing. You will put them on your sons and daughters, and you shall plunder the Egyptians."





\s5
\c 4
\p
\v 1 Moses answered again, "But what if they do not believe me or listen to me but say, 'Yahweh has not appeared to you?'"
\v 2 Yahweh said to him, "What is that in your hand?" Moses said, "A staff."
\v 3 Yahweh said, "Throw it on the ground." Moses threw it on the ground, and it became a serpent, and Moses fled from it.

\s5
\v 4 Yahweh said to Moses, "Put out your hand and take it by the tail." So he put out his hand and took hold of it, and it became a rod in his hand.
\v 5 "This is so they may believe that Yahweh, the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has appeared to you."

\s5
\v 6 Yahweh also said  to him, "Put now your hand into your robe." So he put his hand into his robe and when he brought it out, behold, his hand was leprous, as white as snow.
\v 7 Yahweh said, "Put your hand into your robe again." So he put his hand into his robe again; and when he brought it out of his robe, he saw it was restored again like his other skin.

\s5
\v 8 Yahweh said, "If they will not believe you, or pay attention or believe the first sign, then they will believe the second sign.
\v 9 And if they will not believe even these two signs, or listen to you, then take some water from the river and pour it on the dry land. The water which you take from the river will become blood on the dry land."

\s5
\p
\v 10 Then Moses said to Yahweh, "Oh, Lord, I am not eloquent, neither in the past nor since you have spoken to your servant. I am slow of speech and slow of tongue."
\v 11 Yahweh said to him, "Who has made man’s mouth? Who makes a man mute, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? Is it not I, Yahweh?
\v 12 So now go, and I will be with your mouth and teach you what to say."
\v 13 But Moses said, "Oh, Lord, please send anyone else whom you wish to send."

\s5
\v 14 ThenYahweh became angry with Moses. He said, "What about Aaron, your brother, the Levite? I know that he can speak well. Moreover, he is coming to meet you, and when he sees you, he will be glad in his heart.
\v 15 You will speak to him and put the words in his mouth, and I will be with your mouth and with his mouth, and I will teach you both what you will do.
\v 16 He will speak to the people for you and will be your mouth, and you shall be to him like God.
\v 17 You will take in your hand this staff with which you will do the miracles."

\s5
\v 18 So Moses went back to Jethro his father-in-law and said to him, "Let me go so that I may return to my relatives who are in Egypt and may see if they are still alive." Jethro said to Moses, "Go in peace."
\v 19 Yahweh said to Moses in Midian, "Go, return into Egypt; for all the men are dead who were seeking your life."
\v 20 Moses took his wife and his sons and set them upon a donkey, and he returned to the land of Egypt. And he took the staff of God in his hand.

\s5
\v 21 Yahweh said to Moses, "When you go back into Egypt, see that you do before Pharaoh all the wonders which I have put in your hand. But I will harden his heart, and he will not let the people go.
\v 22 You must say to Pharaoh, 'Thus says Yahweh: Israel is my son, my first-born,
\v 23 and I say to you, "Let my son go, that he may serve me." But since you have refused to let him go, I will certainly kill your son, your first-born.'"

\s5
\v 24 Now on the way, when they stopped for the night, Yahweh met Moses and sought to kill him.
\v 25 Then Zipporah took a flint knife and cut off the foreskin of her son, and touched it to Moses' feet; and she said, "Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me."
\v 26 So Yahweh let him alone. She said, 'A bridegroom of blood are you' because of the circumcision.

\s5
\p
\v 27 Yahweh said to Aaron, "Go into the wilderness to meet Moses." Aaron went, met him in the mountain of God, and kissed him.
\v 28 Moses told Aaron all the words of Yahweh, who had sent him, and all the signs that Yahweh had commanded him.

\s5
\v 29 Then Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the Israelites.
\v 30 Aaron spoke all the words that Yahweh had spoken to Moses and did the signs in the sight of the people.
\v 31 The people believed. When they heard that Yahweh had observed the Israelites and that he had seen their oppression, then they bowed their heads and worshiped.






\s5
\c 5
\p
\v 1 After these things, Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said, "Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, 'Let my people go, that they may have a festival to me in the wilderness.'"
\v 2 Pharaoh said, "Who is Yahweh, that I should listen to his voice to let Israel go? I do not know Yahweh, and moreover, I will not let Israel go."

\s5
\v 3 They said, "The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Let us go on a three-day journey into the wilderness and sacrifice to Yahweh our God so that he does not attack us with plague or with the sword."
\v 4 But the king of Egypt said to them, "Moses and Aaron, why do you take the people from their work? Return to your work."
\v 5 Pharaoh said, "The people of the land are now many, and you are making them rest from their labors."

\s5
\v 6 That same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people and their foremen, saying,
\v 7 "You will no longer give the people straw to make brick, unlike before. Let them go and gather straw for themselves.
\v 8 However, the  same number of the bricks which they made before, you will still require from them. Do not reduce anything required, for they are lazy. That is why they cry, saying, 'Let us go and sacrifice to our God.'
\v 9 Increase the work for the men so that they keep at it and pay no attention to lying words."

\s5
\p
\v 10 So the taskmasters of the people and their foremen went out and told the people, saying, "Thus says Pharaoh, 'I will no longer give you straw.
\v 11 Go yourselves, get straw wherever you can find it, but your workload will not be reduced.'"

\s5
\v 12 So the people scattered throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.
\v 13 The taskmasters were urging them, saying, "Complete your work, just as when there was straw."
\v 14 The Israelite foremen whom Pharaoh’s taskmasters had set over them were beaten and were asked, "Why have you not completed your required amount of bricks both yesterday and today as in the past?"

\s5
\p
\v 15 Then the Israelite foremen came and cried to Pharaoh, saying, "Why are you  treating your servants this way?
\v 16 No straw is given to your servants, but they say to us, 'Make bricks!' and your servants are even beaten; but the fault is with your own people."
\v 17 But Pharaoh said, "You are lazy! You are lazy! You say, 'Let us go and sacrifice to the Lord.'
\v 18 So now go back to work. There will be no straw given to you, but you must deliver your quotaof bricks."

\s5
\v 19 The Israelite foremen saw that they were in trouble when they were told, "You will not reduce the daily quota  of your bricks."
\v 20 They met Moses and Aaron, who stood outside, as they went out from Pharaoh.
\v 21 They said to Moses and Aaron, "May Yahweh look on you and judge because you have made us offensive in the sight of Pharaoh and his servants. You have put a sword in their hand to kill us."

\s5
\p
\v 22 Moses returned to Yahweh and said, "Lord, why have you caused trouble for this people? Why did you ever send me?
\v 23 For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has caused trouble for this people, and you have not delivered your people at all."





\s5
\c 6
\p
\v 1 Then Yahweh said to Moses, "Now you will see what I will do to Pharaoh, for by my strong hand he will let them go, and by my strong hand he will drive them out of his land."

\s5
\p
\v 2 God spoke to Moses and said to him, "I am Yahweh.
\v 3 I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob as God Almighty; but by my name, Yahweh, I was not known to them.
\v 4 I also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their journeying, where they wandered.
\v 5 Moreover, I have heard the groaning of the Israelites whom the Egyptians have enslaved, and I have remembered my covenant.

\s5
\v 6 Therefore, say to the Israelites, 'I am Yahweh. I will bring you out from slavery under the Egyptians, and I will deliver you from their power. I will rescue you with an outstretched arm and with great judgments.
\v 7 I will take you to myself as my people, and I will be your God. You will know that I am Yahweh, your God, who brought you out from slavery under the Egyptians.

\s5
\v 8 I will bring you into the land which I swore to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. I will give it you as a possession. I am Yahweh.'"
\v 9 When Moses told this to the Israelites, they would not listen to him because of discouragement and harsh slavery.

\s5
\p
\v 10 So Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 11 "Go tell Pharaoh, king of Egypt, to let the people of Israel go from his land."
\v 12 Moses said to Yahweh, "If the Israelites have not listened to me, how then will Pharaoh listen me, since I speak with difficulty?"
\v 13 Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron and gave them a command for the Israelites and for Pharaoh, king of Egypt, to bring the Israelites out of the land of Egypt.

\s5
\p
\v 14 These were the heads of their fathers’ houses. The sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel were Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi. These were the families of Reuben.
\v 15 The sons of Simeon were Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul—the son of a Canaanite woman. These were the families of Simeon.

\s5
\v 16 These were the names of the sons of Levi listed by their generations. They were Gershon,  Kohath, and Merari. The years of the life of Levi were 137 years.
\v 17 The sons of Gershon were Libni and Shimei, listed by their families.
\v 18 The sons of Kohath were Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel. The years of the life of Kohath were 133 years.
\v 19 The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi. These were the families of the Levites listed by their generations.

\s5
\v 20 Amram married Jochebed, his father’s sister,  and she bore him Aaron and Moses. Amram lived 137 years and died
\v 21 The sons of Izhar were Korah, Nepheg, and Zichri.
\v 22 The sons of Uzziel were Mishael, Elzaphan, and Sithri.

\s5
\v 23 Aaron married Elisheba, the daughter of Amminadab, the sister of Nahshon. She bore him Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.
\v 24 The sons of Korah were Assir, Elkanah, and Abiasaph. These were the families of the Korahites.
\v 25 Eleazar, Aaron’s son, married one of the daughters of Putiel, and she bore him Phinehas. These were the heads of the fathers’ houses of the Levites listed by their families.

\s5
\v 26 These were the Aaron and Moses to whom the Lord said, "Bring out the Israelites from the land of Egypt, company by company."
\v 27 They spoke to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, to bring out the Israelites from Egypt. These were the same Moses and Aaron.

\s5
\p
\v 28 When Yahweh spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt,
\v 29 he said to Moses, "I am Yahweh. Say to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, all that I say to you."
\v 30 But Moses said Yahweh, "I speak with difficulty, so why should Pharaoh listen to me?"





\s5
\c 7
\p
\v 1 Yahweh said to Moses, "See, I have made you as God to Pharaoh; and Aaron your brother will be your prophet.
\v 2 You will say all that I command you. Aaron your brother will speak to Pharaoh so that he will let the people of Israel go out of his land.

\s5
\v 3 Yet I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and I will multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt.
\v 4 But Pharaoh will not listen to you, so I will lay my hand upon Egypt and bring forth my companies, my people, the descendants  of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great acts of judgment.
\v 5 The Egyptians will know that I am Yahweh when I stretch forth my hand upon Egypt and bring out the Israelites from among them."

\s5
\v 6 Moses and Aaron did so; they did just as Yahweh commanded them.
\v 7 Moses was eighty years old, and Aaron eighty-three years old when they spoke to Pharaoh.

\s5
\p
\v 8 Yahweh said to Moses and to Aaron,
\v 9 "When Pharaoh  says to you, 'Do a miracle,' then you will say to Aaron, 'Take your staff and throw it down before Pharaoh so that it may become a snake.'"
\v 10 Then Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh, and they did just as Yahweh had commanded. Aaron threw down his staff before Pharaoh and his servants, and it became a snake.

\s5
\v 11 Then Pharaoh also called for the wise men and the sorcerers. They did the same thing by their magic. 
\v 12 Each man threw down his staff, and the staffs became snakes. But Aaron’s staff swallowed up their snakes.
\v 13 Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he did not listen, just as Yahweh had foretold.

\s5
\p
\v 14 Yahweh said to Moses, "Pharaoh’s heart is hard, and he refuses to let the people go.
\v 15 Go to Pharaoh in the morning when he goes out to the water. Stand on the river bank to meet him, and take in your hand the staff that had turned into a snake.

\s5
\v 16 Say to him, 'Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, has sent me to you to say, "Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness. Until now you have not listened."
\v 17 Thus says Yahweh, "By this you will know that I am Yahweh. I am going to strike the water of the Nile River with my staff that is in my hand, and the river will be turned to blood.
\v 18 The fish that are in the river will die, and the river will stink. The Egyptians will not be able to drink water from the river."'"

\s5
\v 19 Then Yahweh said to Moses, "Say to Aaron, 'Take your staff and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt, over their rivers, over their streams, over their pools, and over all their ponds, that they may become blood. Do this so that there will be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, even in containers of wood and stone.'"

\s5
\p
\v 20 Moses and Aaron did as Yahweh commanded. Aaron raised the staff and struck the water that was in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh and in the sight of his servants. All the water that was in the river turned to blood.
\v 21 The fish that were in the river died, and the river began to stink. The Egyptians could not drink water from the river, and the blood was everywhere in the land of Egypt.
\v 22 But the magicians of Egypt did the same thing with their magic. So Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he refused to listen to Moses and Aaron, just as Yahweh had said.

\s5
\v 23 Then Pharaoh turned and went into his house. He did not even pay attention to this.
\v 24 All the Egyptians dug around  the river for water to drink, but they could not drink the water of the river.
\v 25 Seven days passed after Yahweh had attacked the river.





\s5
\c 8
\p
\v 1 Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, "Go to Pharaoh and tell  him, 'Thus says Yahweh, "Let my people go, that they may serve me.
\v 2 If you refuse to let them go, I will plague all your country with frogs.
\v 3 The river will swarm with frogs, and they will come up and go into your house, into your bedroom, and on your bed, and into the house of your servants, and on your people, into your ovens, and into your kneading-troughs.
\v 4 The frogs will come up against you, your people, and all your servants."'"

\s5
\v 5 Yahweh said to Moses, "Say to Aaron, 'Stretch forth your hand with your staff over the rivers, over the streams, and over the pools, and bring the frogs up over the land of Egypt.'"
\v 6 Aaron stretched forth his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs came up and covered the land of Egypt.
\v 7 The magicians did the same with their magic and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt.

\s5
\p
\v 8 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron and said, "Pray to Yahweh, that he may take away the frogs from me and from my people, and I will let the people go, that they may sacrifice to Yahweh."
\v 9 Moses said to Pharaoh, "You may have the privilege of telling me when I should pray for you, for your servants, and for your people, for the frogs to be removed from you and your houses and remain only in the river."

\s5
\v 10 Pharaoh said, "Tomorrow." Moses said, "Be it as you say so that you may know that there is no one like Yahweh, our God.
\v 11 The frogs will leave you, your houses, your servants, and your people. They will stay only in the river."
\v 12 Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh. Moses cried out to Yahweh concerning the frogs which he had brought on Pharaoh.

\s5
\v 13 Yahweh did as Moses asked and the frogs died in the houses, the courts, and the fields.
\v 14 The people gathered them together in heaps, and the land stank.
\v 15 But when Pharaoh saw that there was relief, he hardened his heart and did not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as Yahweh had said.

\s5
\p
\v 16 Yahweh said to Moses, "Say to Aaron, 'Stretch out your staff and strike the dust of the earth, that it may become gnats throughout all the land of Egypt.'"
\v 17 They did so; and Aaron stretched out his hand with his staff and struck the dust of the earth. Gnats came upon man and beast. All the dust of the ground became gnats throughout the whole land of Egypt.

\s5
\v 18 The magicians tried with their magic to bring forth gnats, but they could not. There were gnats upon man and beast.
\v 19 Then the magicians said to Pharaoh, "This is the finger of God." But Pharaoh’s heart was hardened. He would not listen to them. It was just as Yahweh had said.

\s5
\p
\v 20 Yahweh said to Moses, "Get up early in the morning and stand before Pharaoh as he goes out to the water. Say to him, 'Thus says Yahweh, "Let my people go so that they may serve me.
\v 21 However, if you do not let my people go, I will send swarms of flies on you, your servants, and your people, and into your houses.  The houses of the Egyptians will be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground they stand on will be full of flies.

\s5
\v 22 But on that day I will set apart the land of Goshen, in which my people will make their homes, so that no swarms of flies will be there. This will happen so that you may know that I am Yahweh in the midst of this land.
\v 23 I will put a separation between my people and your people. This sign will take place tomorrow."'"
\v 24 Yahweh did so, and thick swarms of flies came into Pharaoh's house and into his servants’ houses. Throughout the whole land of Egypt, the land was ruined because of the swarms of flies.

\s5
\p
\v 25 Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron and said, "Go, sacrifice to your God in the land."
\v 26 Moses said, "It is not right to do so, for the  sacrifices we make to Yahweh our God are an abomination to the Egyptians. If we make sacrifices that are an abomination to the Egyptians right before their eyes, will they not stone us?
\v 27 We must go three days’ journey into the wilderness and sacrifice to Yahweh our God, as he commands us."

\s5
\v 28 Pharaoh said, "I will let you go so that you may sacrifice to Yahweh your God in the wilderness. Only you must not go very far away. And pray for me."
\v 29 Moses said, "As soon as I go out from you, I will pray to Yahweh that the swarms of flies may leave Pharaoh, his servants, and his people tomorrow. But Pharaoh must not deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to Yahweh."

\s5
\v 30 Moses went out from Pharaoh and prayed to Yahweh.
\v 31 Yahweh did as Moses asked and removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, his servants, and his people. Not one remained.
\v 32 But Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also, and he did not let the people go.





\s5
\c 9
\p
\v 1 Then Yahweh said to Moses, "Go to Pharaoh and tell him, 'Thus says Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, "Let my people go, that they may worship me."
\v 2 For if you refuse to let them go, and will hold them still,
\v 3 then the hand of Yahweh will be on your cattle that are in the field, on the horses, the donkeys, the camels, the herds, and the flocks, with a terrible disease.
\v 4 Yahweh will distinguish between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt; nothing will die of all that belongs to the Israelites.

\s5
\v 5 Yahweh has appointed a set time, saying, "Tomorrow Yahweh will do this thing in the land."
\v 6 Yahweh did this the next day, and all the cattle of Egypt died. But none of the cattle of the people of Israel died, not one.
\v 7 Pharaoh investigated, and, behold, not even one of the cattle of the Israelites died. But the heart of Pharaoh was stubborn, and he did not let the people go.

\s5
\p
\v 8 Then Yahweh said to Moses and to Aaron, "Take handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and have Moses throw it into the air while Pharaoh is watching.
\v 9 It shall become small dust over all the land of Egypt and shall cause blisters and sores to break out on man and on animals throughout all the land of Egypt."
\v 10 They took ashes of the furnace and stood before Pharaoh. Then Moses threw the ashes into the air, and they caused blisters and sores to break out on man and on beast.

\s5
\v 11 The magicians could not stand before Moses because of the blisters, for the blisters were on the magicians and on all the Egyptians.
\v 12 Yahweh hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he did not listen to Moses and Aaron. This was just as Yahweh had said to Moses.

\s5
\v 13 Then Yahweh said to Moses, "Get up early in the morning, stand before Pharaoh, and say to him, 'Thus says Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, "Let my people go, that they may serve me.
\v 14 For I will this time send all my plagues upon you yourself, upon your servants, and upon your people. I will do this so that you may know that there is no one like me in all the earth.

\s5
\v 15 For by now I could have stretched out my hand and attacked you and your people with disease, and you would have been destroyed from the earth.
\v 16 But for this reason I have made you to survive, to show you my power, so that my name may be declared throughout all the earth.
\v 17 You are still exalting yourself against my people by not letting them go.

\s5
\v 18 Listen, tomorrow about this time I will bring a very great hail storm as has not been seen in Egypt since the day it was founded even until now.
\v 19 Now therefore send and gather your cattle and all that you have in the field to a safe place. Every man and animal that is in the field and is not brought home—the hail will come down on them, and they will die."'"

\s5
\v 20 Then those who feared the word of Yahweh among Pharaoh's servants hurried to bring their slaves and cattle into the houses.
\v 21 But those who did not take the word of Yahweh seriously left their slaves and cattle in the field.

\s5
\p
\v 22 Yahweh said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand toward the sky so that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, on man and on beast and on every plant in the field throughout the land of Egypt."
\v 23  Moses stretched out his staff toward the sky, and Yahweh sent thunder, hail, and lightning to the earth. He also rained hail upon the land of Egypt.
\v 24 So there was hail and lightning mingled with the hail, very severe, that had not been in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.

\s5
\v 25 The hail struck throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both man and animal, and the hail struck every plant of the field and broke every tree of the field.
\v 26 Only in the land of Goshen, where the Israelites were, was there no hail.

\s5
\p
\v 27 Then Pharaoh sent and summoned Moses and Aaron. He said to them, "I have sinned this time. Yahweh is righteous, and I and my people are wicked.
\v 28 Pray to Yahweh, for the mighty thundering bolts and hail are too much. I will let you go, and you will stay here no longer."

\s5
\v 29 Moses said to him, "As soon as I leave the city, I will spread my hands to Yahweh. The thunder shall cease and there will not be any more hail so that you might know that the earth is Yahweh's.
\v 30 But as for you and your servants, I know that you do not yet fear Yahweh God."

\s5
\v 31 Now the flax and the barley were ruined, for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was in bloom.
\v 32 But the wheat and the spelt were not harmed because they were later crops.
\v 33 When Moses had left Pharaoh and the city, he spread forth his hands to Yahweh; the thunder and hail ceased, and the rain stopped on the earth.

\s5
\v 34 When Pharaoh saw that the rain, hail, and thunder had ceased, he sinned again and hardened his heart, with his servants.
\v 35 The heart of Pharaoh was hardened, so he did not let the people of Israel go, as Yahweh had spoken by Moses.





\s5
\c 10
\p
\v 1 Yahweh said to Moses, "Go to Pharaoh, for I have hardened his heart and the heart of his servants so that I may show these signs among them,
\v 2 and so that you may tell your children and grandchildren what things I have done and how I dealt harshly with Egypt, and of my signs that I have done among them; that you may know that I am Yahweh."

\s5
\v 3 So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said to him, "Thus says Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, 'How long will you refuse to humble yourself before me? Let my people go, that they may worship me.
\v 4 But if you refuse to let my people go, listen, tomorrow I will bring locusts into your territory.

\s5
\v 5 They will cover the face of the earth so that one will not be able to see the earth. They will eat the remains of that which escaped from the hail. They will also eat every tree that grows for you in the fields.
\v 6 They will fill your houses and the houses of all your servants and the houses of all the Egyptians—something neither your fathers nor your grandfathers have seen since the day that they were upon the earth to this day.'"  Then Moses left and went out from Pharaoh.

\s5
\v 7 Pharaoh’s servants said to him, "How long will this man be a menace to us? Let the Israelites go so that they may worship Yahweh their God. Do you not yet know that Egypt is destroyed?"
\v 8 Moses and Aaron were brought again to Pharaoh, and he said to them, "Go worship Yahweh your God. Which people will go?"

\s5
\v 9 Moses said, "We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters. With our flocks and with our herds we will go, for we must have a festival for Yahweh."
\v 10 Pharaoh said to them, "May Yahweh indeed be with you, if I ever let you go and your little ones go. Look, you have some evil in mind.
\v 11 No! Go, just the men among you, and worship Yahweh, for that is what you want." Then Moses and Aaron were driven out from Pharaoh’s presence.

\s5
\v 12 Then Yahweh said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt to the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of Egypt and eat every plant of the land, everything that the hail has left."
\v 13 Moses stretched out his staff over the land of Egypt, and Yahweh brought an east wind upon the land all that day and all the night, and when it was morning, the east wind had brought the locusts.

\s5
\v 14 The locusts went through all the land of Egypt and infested all the territory of Egypt; so many locusts had never before been in the land and never will be again.
\v 15 They covered the face of the whole land so that the land was darkened. They ate every plant of the land and all the fruit of the trees that the hail had left. There did not remain any living green plant, neither tree or plant of the field, through all the land of Egypt.

\s5
\v 16 Then Pharaoh quickly summoned Moses and Aaron and said, "I have sinned against Yahweh your God and against you.
\v 17 Now therefore forgive my sin this time, and pray to Yahweh your God that he will only take away this death from me."
\v 18 So Moses went out from Pharaoh and prayed to Yahweh.

\s5
\v 19 Yahweh brought a very strong west wind that picked up the locusts and drove them into the Red Sea; not one locust remained in all the territory of Egypt.
\v 20 But Yahweh hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and Pharaoh did not let the Israelites go.


\s5
\p
\v 21 Yahweh said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand toward the sky, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, darkness that may be felt."
\v 22 Moses stretched out his hand toward the sky, and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt for three days.
\v 23 No one could see anyone else; neither did anyone leave his home for three days. However, all the Israelites had light in the place where they lived.

\s5
\v 24 Pharaoh summoned Moses and said, "Go worship Yahweh, but your flocks and herds must remain behind. Even your families may go with you."
\v 25 But Moses said, "You must also give us sacrifices and burnt offeringsso that we may sacrifice them to Yahweh our God.
\v 26 Our cattle must also go with us; not a hoof may be left behind, for we must take them to worship Yahweh our God. For we do not know with what we must worship Yahweh until we arrive there."

\s5
\v 27 But Yahweh hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he would not let them go.
\v 28 Pharaoh said to Moses, "Go from me! Be sure that you do not see me again, for in the day you see my face, you will die."
\v 29 Moses said, "You have spoken. I will not see your face again."
 




\s5
\c 11
\p
\v 1 Then Yahweh said to Moses," Still one more plague I will bring on Pharaoh and Egypt; after that, he will let you go from here. When he finally lets you go, he will drive you away completely.
\v 2 Instruct the people that every man and every woman is to ask of his or her neighbor for jewels of silver, and jewels of gold."
\v 3 Yahweh gave the people favor with the Egyptians. Moreover, the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt in the sight of Pharaoh’s servants and in the sight of the people.

\s5
\p
\v 4 Moses said, "Thus says Yahweh, 'About midnight I will go throughout Egypt.
\v 5 All the firstborn in the land of Egypt will die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sits upon his throne, even to the firstborn of the slave girl who is behind the handmill and all the firstborn of the cattle.

\s5
\v 6 Then there will be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt such as there has never been nor ever will be again.
\v 7 But against any of the people of Israel not even a dog will bark, against either man or beast, so that you may know that Yahweh distinguishes between the Egyptians and Israel.'
\v 8 All these your servants will come down to me and bow down themselves to me, saying, 'Go, you and all the people who follow you!' After that I will go out." Then he went out from Pharaoh in great anger.

\s5
\p
\v 9 Yahweh said to Moses, "Pharaoh will not listen to you so that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt."
\v 10 Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh. But Yahweh hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and Pharaoh did not let the people of Israel go out of his land.





\s5
\c 12
\p
\v 1 Yahweh spoke to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying,
\v 2 "This month shall be to you the beginning of months. It shall be the first month of the year to you.

\s5
\v 3 Tell the assembly of Israel, saying, 'On the tenth day of this month they must each take a lamb for themselves, each family doing this, a lamb for each household.
\v 4 If the household is too small for a lamb, the man and his next door neighbor are to take a lamb, that would be enough for the number of the people. Enough for each one to eat, so you will take enough lamb to feed them all.

\s5
\v 5 Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male one year old. You may take it from the sheep or from the goats.
\v 6 You will keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month. Then the whole assembly of Israel will kill it at the evening twilight.
\v 7 They will take some of the blood and put it on the two side-posts and on the top of the door frame of the houses where they will eat it.
\v 8 They will eat the meat that night, roasted over a fire, with bread made without yeast and with bitter herbs.

\s5
\v 9 Do not eat it raw or boiled in water, but roast it over fire with its head, its legs and its inner parts.
\v 10 You must not let any of it remain until the morning. That which remains of it until the morning you will burn with fire.
\v 11 This is how you will eat it—with your belt fastened, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand. You will eat it in haste. It is Yahweh's Passover.

\s5
\v 12 For I will go through the land of Egypt in that night and attack all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast. Against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments. I am Yahweh.
\v 13 The blood will be a sign for you on the houses where you are. When I see the blood, I will pass over you, and this  plague will not be on you to destroy you when I attack the land of Egypt.
\v 14 This day will become a memorial day for you, and you will observe it as a festival to Yahweh. Throughout your generations you will observe it as an ordinance forever.

\s5
\p
\v 15 For seven days you will eat bread without yeast. On the first day you will remove the yeast from your houses. Whoever eats leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that person shall be cut off from Israel.
\v 16 On the first day there will be a holy convocation, and on the seventh day there will be a holy convocation. No work will be done on these days, except the cooking for everyone to eat--that is the only work that may be done by you.

\s5
\v 17 You must observe the festival of unleavened bread because on this day I brought your companies out of the land of Egypt. So you must observe this day throughout your generations as an ordinance forever.
\v 18 In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at twilight, you will eat unleavened bread until the twenty-first day of the month at twilight.

\s5
\v 19 For seven days, no yeast must be found in your houses, for whoever eats that which is made with yeast, that person will be cut off from the community of Israel, whether he be a foreigner or one that was born in the land.
\v 20 You will eat nothing made with yeast. In all the places where you live, you must eat bread without yeast."

\s5
\p
\v 21 Then Moses summoned all the elders of Israel and said to them, "Go and select lambs that will be enough to feed your families, and kill the Passover lamb.
\v 22 Then take a bunch of hyssop and dip it in the blood that is in the basin. Apply the blood to the top of the doorframe and the two side posts with the blood that is in the basin. None of you is to go out of the door of his house until the morning.

\s5
\v 23 For Yahweh will pass through to attack the Egyptians. When he sees the blood on the top of the doorframe and on he two side posts, Yahweh will pass over the door and will not permit the destroyer to come into your houses to attack you.

\s5
\v 24 You shall observe this event for an ordinance to you and to your children forever.
\v 25 When you are enter the land which Yahweh will give you, just as he has promised, you must observe this service.

\s5
\v 26 When your children ask you, 'What does this service mean to you?'
\v 27 then you will say, 'It is the sacrifice of Yahweh's Passover, who passed over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt when he attacked the Egyptians and delivered our households.'" Then the people bowed down and worshiped.
\v 28 The Israelites went and did exactly as Yahweh had commanded Moses and Aaron.

\s5
\p
\v 29 It happened at midnight that Yahweh attacked all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne to the firstborn of the captive that was in the prison and all the firstborn of cattle.
\v 30 Pharaoh got up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt, for there was not a house where there was not someone dead.

\s5
\v 31 He summoned Moses and Aaron in the night and said, "Get up, get out from among my people, both you and the Israelites. Go, worship Yahweh, as you have said.
\v 32 Take both your flocks and your herds, as you have said, and be gone, and bless me also."
\v 33 The Egyptians were in a hurry to send them out of the land, for they said, "We are all dead people."

\s5
\v 34 So the people took their dough before the yeast was added, their kneading troughs being bound up in their clothes on their shoulders.
\v 35 Now the people of Israel did as Moses told them. They asked of the Egyptians jewels of silver, jewels of gold, and clothing.
\v 36 Yahweh gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians so that the Egyptians gave to the Israelites whatever they asked. So they plundered the Egyptians.

\s5
\p
\v 37 The Israelites journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about 600,000 men on foot, plus women and children.
\v 38 A mixed multitude went up also with them, and flocks and herds, a very large number of cattle.
\v 39 They baked bread without yeast in the dough which they brought from Egypt. It was without yeast because they were driven out of Egypt and could not delay or had they prepared food for themselves.
\v 40 The Israelites had lived in Egypt for 430 years.

\s5
\v 41 At the end of 430 years, on that very day, all the companies of Yahweh went out from the land of Egypt.
\v 42 This was a night of vigil to Yahweh for bringing them out from the land of Egypt. This is that night of Yahweh to be much observed by all the Israelites throughout their generations.

\s5
\p
\v 43 Yahweh said to Moses and Aaron, "This is the ordinance of the Passover. No foreigner may share in eating it,
\v 44 but every man’s slave who is bought for money, after you have circumcised him, then he may eat it.

\s5
\v 45 A foreigner and a hired servant must not eat of it.
\v 46 It must be eaten in one house; you must not carry any of the meat out of the house, and you must not break a bone of it.

\s5
\v 47 All the community of Israel must observe it.
\v 48 When a foreigner lives with you and wants to observe the Passover to Yahweh, all his male people must be circumcised, and then he may approach and observe it. He will be like one who was born in the land. However, no uncircumcised person may eat of it.

\s5
\v 49 One law will apply to both the native-born and to the foreigner who lives among you."
\v 50 So all the Israelites did exactly  as Yahweh had commanded Moses and Aaron.
\v 51 It came about that very day that Yahweh brought Israel out of the land of Egypt by their companies.





\s5
\c 13
\p
\v 1 Yahweh  spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 2 "Consecrate to me all the firstborn, every first born male among the Israelites, both of man and of animal. The firstborn is mine."

\s5
\p
\v 3 Moses said to the people, "Remember this day, on which you came out from Egypt, out of the house of slavery, for by Yahweh's strong hand he brought you out from this place. No bread with yeast will be eaten.
\v 4 On this day, in the month Abib, you are going out of Egypt.
\v 5 When Yahweh brings you into the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, which he swore to your fathers to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey, then you will keep this service in this month.

\s5
\v 6 For seven days you will eat bread without yeast; in the seventh day there will be a feast to Yahweh.
\v 7 Bread without yeast will be eaten throughout the seven days; no bread with yeast will be seen among you, neither will there be yeast seen with you in any of your borders.

\s5
\v 8 You are to say to your children on that day, 'It is because of what Yahweh did for me when I came  out of Egypt.'
\v 9 It will be for a sign to you upon your hand and for a memorial on your forehead, that the instruction of Yahweh may be in your mouth, for with a strong hand Yahweh brought you out of Egypt.
\v 10 You will therefore keep this ordinance in its season from year to year.

\s5
\p
\v 11 When Yahweh brings you into the land of the Canaanites, as he swore to you and to your fathers, and gives it to you,
\v 12 you will set apart to him every firstborn child and the first offspring of your animals. The males will be Yahweh's.
\v 13 Every firstborn of a donkey you will redeem with a lamb. If you do not redeem it, then you will break its neck; and all the firstborn males among your sons you must redeem.

\s5
\v 14 When your son asks you later, 'What is this?' then you are to tell him, 'By a strong hand Yahweh brought us out from Egypt, from the house of slavery.
\v 15 When Pharaoh stubbornly refused let us go, Yahweh killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man and the firstborn of animals. Therefore, I sacrifice to Yahweh the firstborn male of every animal, but the firstborn of my sons I redeem.'
\v 16 It will be for a sign upon your hand, and for frontlets on your forehead, for by a strong hand Yahweh brought us out of Egypt."

\s5
\p
\v 17 When Pharaoh let the people go, God did not lead them by way of the land of the Philistines, although that was nearby. For God said, "Perhaps the people will change their minds when they experience war and will return to Egypt."
\v 18 So God led the people around through the desert to the Red Sea. The Israelites went up out of the land of Egypt armed for battle.

\s5
\v 19 Moses took the bones of Joseph with him, for Joseph had made the Israelites solemnly swear, saying, "God will surely rescue you, and you will carry up my bones away with you."
\v 20 The Israelites journeyed from Succoth and camped in Etham on the edge of the desert.
\v 21 Yahweh went before them by day in a pillar of cloud to lead them in the way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light so that they might go by day and by night.
\v 22 The pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night he did not remove from before the people.





\s5
\c 14
\p
\v 1 Yahweh spoke to Moses:
\v 2 "Say to the Israelites that they should turn and camp before Pi Hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, before Baal Zephon. Over against it you are to camp by the sea.
\v 3 Pharaoh will say of the Israelites, 'They are wandering in the land; the desert has closed in on them.'

\s5
\v 4 I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and he will follow after them. I will get honor over Pharaoh and over all his army, and the Egyptians will know that I am Yahweh." So the Israelites did so.
\v 5 When the king of Egypt was told that the people had fled, the hearts of Pharaoh and of his servants were turned against the people. They said, "What is this we have done, that we have let Israel go from serving us?"

\s5
\v 6 Then he made ready his chariots and took his army with him.
\v 7 He took six hundred select chariots and all the other chariots of Egypt with officers on all of them.
\v 8 Yahweh hardened the heart of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and he pursued the Israelites.  Now the  Israelites went out in triumph.
\v 9 The Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, his horsemen, and his army; and they overtook the Israelites camping by the sea beside Pi Hahiroth, before Baal-zephon.

\s5
\p
\v 10 When Pharaoh came close, the Israelites looked up and were surprised.  The Egyptians were marching after them, and they were terrified.  The Israelites cried out to Yahweh.
\v 11 They said to Moses, "Is it because there were no graves in Egypt, that  you have you taken us away to die in the desert? Why have you treated us like this, bringing us out of Egypt?
\v 12 Isn’t this what we told you in Egypt, saying, 'Leave us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians?' For it would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness."

\s5
\v 13 Moses said to the people, “Do not fear. Stand still and see the salvation of Yahweh which he will provide for you today, for the Egyptians whom you have seen today, you will never see again. 
\v 14 Yahweh will fight for you, and you can be still.”

\s5
\v 15 Then Yahweh said to Moses, “Why do you cry to me? Speak to the Israelites to go forward.
\v 16 Lift up your staff, stretch out your hand over the sea and divide it so that the people of Israel may go through the sea on dry ground.
\v 17 Be aware that I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians so that they will go after them. I will get  honor through Pharaoh and  all his army, his chariots, and his horsemen.
\v 18 The Egyptians will know that I am Yahweh when I have received honor because of Pharaoh, his chariots, and his horsemen."

\s5
\v 19 The angel of God, who went before the camp of Israel, moved and went behind them. The pillar of cloud moved from before them and stood behind them.
\v 20 It came between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Israel. It was a dark cloud, but it lit the night so that one did not come near the other all night.

\s5
\p
\v 21 Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and Yahweh drove the sea back by a strong east wind all that night and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.
\v 22 The Israelites went into the middle of the sea on the dry ground. The waters formed a wall to them on their right hand and on their left.

\s5
\v 23 The Egyptians pursued and went after them into the middle of the sea, all Pharaoh’s horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.
\v 24 But in the morning watch, Yahweh looked down on the army of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and cloud and caused panic among the Egyptians,
\v 25 clogging their chariot wheels, and they drove with difficulty. So the Egyptians said, "Let's flee from Israel, for Yahweh fights for them against the Egyptians."

\s5
\p
\v 26 Yahweh said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand over the sea so that the waters may return down upon the Egyptians, on their chariots, and on their horsemen."
\v 27 So Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its normal course when the morning appeared. The Egyptians fled into it, but Yahweh overthrew the Egyptians in the middle of the sea.
\v 28 The waters returned and covered the chariots, the horsemen, and all the army of Pharaoh that went in after them into the sea. Not one of them survived.

\s5
\v 29 But the Israelites walked on dry land in the middle of the sea. The waters were a wall to them on their right hand and on their left.
\v 30 So Yahweh saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore.
\v 31 When Israel saw the great power that Yahweh used against the Egyptians, the people feared Yahweh, and they believed in Yahweh and in his servant Moses.





\s5
\c 15
\p
\v 1 Then Moses and the people of Israel sang this song to Yahweh. They said,
\q "I will sing to Yahweh, for he has triumphed gloriously;
\q the horse and his rider he thrown into the sea.

\s5
\q
\v 2 Yahweh is my strength and song,
\q And he has become my salvation.
\q This is my God, and I will praise him,
\q My father’s God, and I will exalt him.
\q
\v 3 Yahweh is a man of war;
\q Yahweh is his name.

\s5
\q
\v 4 Pharaoh’s chariots and his army he has thrown into the sea,
\q His chosen officers were drowned in the Red Sea.
\q
\v 5 The depths covered them;
\q They went down into the depths like a stone.

\s5
\q
\v 6 Your right hand, O Yahweh, is glorious in power;
\q Your right hand, O Yahweh, has shattered the enemy.
\q
\v 7 In great majesty you overthrew those who rose up against you. 
\q You sent out your wrath; it consumed them like stubble.
\q
\v 8 By the blast of your nostrils the waters were piled up;
\q The flowing waters stood upright like a heap;
\q The deep water was congealed in the heart of the sea.

\s5
\q
\v 9 The enemy said, 'I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil;
\q My desire will be satisfied on them;
\q I will draw my sword; my hand will destroy them.'
\q
\v 10 But you blew with your wind, and the sea covered them;
\q They sank like lead in the mighty waters.
\q
\v 11 Who is like you, Yahweh, among the gods?
\q Who is like you, majestic in holiness,
\q Fearful in praises, doing wonders?

\s5
\q
\v 12 You stretched out your right hand,
\q and the earth swallowed them.
\q
\v 13 In your steadfast love you have led the people you have redeemed.
\q You have led them in your strength to the holy place where you live. 

\s5
\q
\v 14 The peoples will hear, and they will tremble;
\q anguish will seize the inhabitants of Philistia.
\q
\v 15 Then the chiefs of Edom are dismayed;
\q the mighty men of Moab shake;
\q all the inhabitants of Canaan melt away.

\s5
\q
\v 16 Terror and dread will fall on them;
\q Because of the greatness of your arm, they will be as still as a stone
\q  until your people pass by, Yahweh,
\q until the people pass by whom you have purchased.

\s5
\q
\v 17 You will bring them in and plant them in the mountain of your inheritance,
\q the place, Yahweh, you have made for you to make their homes in,
\q the sanctuary, our Lord, that your hands have established.
\q
\v 18 Yahweh will reign forever and ever."

\s5
\p
\v 19 For the horses of Pharaoh came with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and Yahweh brought back the
waters of the sea on them. But the Israelites walked on dry land in the middle of the sea.
\v 20 Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand, and all the women went out with her with
timbrels and dances.
\v 21 Miriam answered them,
\q "Sing to Yahweh, for he has triumphed gloriously.
\q The horse and his rider has he thrown into the sea."

\s5
\p
\v 22 Then Moses led Israel onward from the Red Sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur. They went three days into
the wilderness and found no water.
\v 23 Then they came to Marah, but they could not drink of the waters of Marah because the water was bitter. Therefore, the name of it
was called Marah.

\s5
\v 24 So the people complained against Moses, saying, "What can we drink?"
\v 25 He cried to Yahweh, and Yahweh showed him a tree. He threw it into the water, and the water was made so that it was sweet to drink. There Yahweh made for them a binding ordinance, and there he tested them.
\v 26 He said, "If you will diligently listen to the voice of Yahweh your God, do what is right in his eyes, pay attention to his commandments, and obey all his ordinances, I will put on you none of the diseases that I 
put upon the Egyptians; for I am Yahweh, who heals you."

\s5
\v 27 They came to Elim, where there were twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees. There they camped by
the water.



  

\s5
\c 16
\p
\v 1 They journeyed from Elim, and all the community of the Israelites came to the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departure from the land of Egypt.
\v 2 The whole community of Israelites complained against Moses and Aaron in the desert.
\v 3 The Israelites said to them," If we had only died by the hand of Yahweh in the land of Egypt when we sat by the pots of meat and ate bread to the full. For you have brought us out into this desert to kill this whole assembly with hunger."

\s5
\p
\v 4 Then Yahweh said to Moses, "I will rain bread from heaven for you. The people will go out and gather a day’s portion every day so that I may test them to see whether or not they will walk in my law.
\v 5 It will come about on the sixth day, that they shall prepare what they bring in, and it will be twice as much as they gather daily."

\s5
\v 6 Then Moses and Aaron said to all the people of Israel, "In the evening you will know that Yahweh has brought you out from the land of Egypt.
\v 7 In the morning you will see the glory of Yahweh, for he hears your complaining against Yahweh. Who are we for you to complain against us?"
\v 8 Moses said, "When Yahweh gives you meat in the evening and bread in the morning  to the full—for Yahweh has heard your complaints that you speak against him. Who are we? Your complaints are not against us, but they are against Yahweh."

\s5
\v 9 Moses said to Aaron, "Say to all the community of the people of Israel, 'Come near before Yahweh, for he has heard your complaints.'"
\v 10 It came about, as Aaron spoke to the whole community of the people of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of Yahweh appeared in the cloud.
\v 11 Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 12 "I have heard the complaints of the people of Israel. Speak to them, saying, 'In the evening you will eat meat, and in the morning you will be filled with bread. Then you will know that I am Yahweh your God.'"

\s5
\p
\v 13 It came about in the evening that the quails came up and covered the camp. In the morning the dew lay round about the camp.
\v 14 When the dew that lay had gone, behold, on the ground in the wilderness was a small round thing as thin as the hoarfrost on the ground.
\v 15 When the people of Israel saw it, they said one to another, "What is it?" They did not know what it was. Moses said to them, "It is the bread which Yahweh has given you to eat.

\s5
\v 16 This is the word that Yahweh has commanded, 'You should gather, every person the amount you need to eat, an omer for each person, according to the total number of people. This is how you will gather it: Gather to enough to eat for every one for those who live within his tent.'"
\v 17 The people of Israel did so. Some gathered more, some gathered less.
\v 18 When they measured it with an omer, he who had gathered much had nothing over, and he who had gathered little had no lack. Each one gathered so that they had enough to meet their need.

\s5
\v 19 Then Moses said to them, "Let no one leave any of it until the morning."
\v 20 However, they did not listen to Moses, but some of them left some of it until the morning, but it bred worms and became foul. Then Moses was angry with them.
\v 21 They gathered it morning by morning, each person gathered enough to eat for the day. When the sun became hot, it melted.

\s5
\v 22 It came about that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each person. All the rulers of the community came and told this to Moses.
\v 23 He said to them, "This is what Yahweh has said, 'Tomorrow is a solemn rest, a holy Sabbath to Yahweh.  Bake what you want to bake, and boil what you want to boil. All that remains over, set it aside for yourselves until the morning.'"

\s5
\v 24 So they laid it up till the morning, as Moses had instructed. It did not become foul, neither was there any worm it in.
\v 25 Moses said, "Eat that food today, for today is a Sabbath to Yahweh. Today you will not find it in the field.

\s5
\v 26 Six days you will gather it, but the seventh day is the Sabbath. In it there will be none."
\v 27 It came about on the seventh day that some of the people went out to gather, but they found no manna.

\s5
\v 28 Then Yahweh said to Moses, "How long will you refuse to keep my commandments and my laws?
\v 29 See, Yahweh has given you the Sabbath. Therefore he gives you on the sixth day the bread for two days.  Let each of you stay in his place; let no one go out from his place on the seventh day."
\v 30 So the people rested on the seventh day.

\s5
\p
\v 31 The people of Israel called the name of the food 'manna.' It was white like coriander seed, and its taste was like wafers made with honey.
\v 32 Moses said, "This is the thing that Yahweh has commanded, 'Let an omer of it be kept throughout your generations so that your descendants might see the bread with which I fed you in the wilderness when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt.'"

\s5
\v 33 Moses said to Aaron, "Take a pot and put an omer of manna into it, and lay it up before Yahweh to be kept throughout your generations."
\v 34 As Yahweh commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony to be kept.
\v 35 The people of Israel ate manna forty years until they came to an inhabited land. They ate it until they came to the borders of the land of Canaan.
\v 36 Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.





\s5
\c 17
\p
\v 1 The whole community of the Israelites journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, following the instruction of Yahweh, and they camped in Rephidim, but there was no water for the people to drink.
\v 2 So the people quarreled with Moses, saying "Give us water that we may drink." Moses said, "Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you test Yahweh?"
\v 3 The people were very thirsty, and the people complained against Moses and said, "Why have you brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst?"

\s5
\v 4 Then Moses cried to Yahweh, "What shall I do with this people? They are almost ready to stone me."
\v 5 Yahweh said to Moses, "Go on ahead of the people, and take with you of the elders of Israel; take your staff with which you struck the river, and go.
\v 6  I will stand before you there upon the rock at Horeb, and you will strike the rock, and water will come out of it so that the people may drink." Then Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.
\v 7 He called the name of the place Massah and Meribah because of the quarreling of the Israelites, and because they tested the Lord, saying, "Is Yahweh among us or not?"

\s5
\p
\v 8 Then Amalek came and attacked Israel at Rephidim.
\v 9 So Moses said to Joshua, "Choose some men and go out, fight with Amalek. Tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the staff of God in my hand."
\v 10 So Joshua fought with Amalek as Moses had instructed while Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.

\s5
\v 11 When Moses held up his hand, Israel prevailed;  when he let his hand rest, Amalek prevailed.
\v 12 When Moses’ hands became heavy, they took a stone and put it under him, and he sat on it while Aaron and Hur held up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side. So his hands were steady until the sun went down.
\v 13 So Joshua defeated Amalek and his people with the sword.

\s5
\v 14 Yahweh said to Moses, "Write this in a book and read it in the hearing of Joshua so that I will utterly blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven."
\v 15 Then Moses built an altar and called it "Yahweh is my banner,"
\v 16 for he said, "Yahweh has sworn that he will have war with Amalek from generation to generation."





\s5
\c 18
\p
\v 1 Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses’ father-in-law, heard of all that God had done for Moses and for Israel his people. He heard that Yahweh had brought Israel out of Egypt.
\v 2 Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, took Zipporah, Moses’ wife, after he had sent her home,
\v 3 and her two sons; the name of the one son was Gershom, for Moses had said, "I have been a foreigner in a foreign land."
\v 4 The name of the other was Eliezer, for Moses had said, "The God of my father was my help and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh."

\s5
\v 5 Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, came with Moses' sons and his wife to Moses in the wilderness where he was camped at the mountain of God.
\v 6 He said to Moses, "I, your father-in-law Jethro, am coming to you with your wife and her two sons."

\s5
\v 7 Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, bowed down, and kissed him, and they asked each other of their welfare. Then they went into the tent.
\v 8 Moses told his father-in-law all that Yahweh had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel’s sake, all the hardship that had come on them along the way, and how Yahweh had delivered them.

\s5
\v 9 Jethro rejoiced over all the good that Yahweh had done for Israel, in that he had delivered them out of the hand of the Egyptians.
\v 10 Jethro said, "Blessed be Yahweh, who has delivered you from the Egyptians and from the hand of Pharaoh, and who has delivered the people from the control of the Egyptians.
\v 11 Now I know that Yahweh is greater than all the gods because when the Egyptians  dealt arrogantly against Israel, God rescued his people."

\s5
\v 12 Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, brought a burnt offering and sacrifices for God. Aaron and all the elders of Israel came to eat a meal with Moses’ father-in-law before God.

\s5
\p
\v 13 On the next day Moses sat to judge the people. The people stood around Moses from morning until evening.
\v 14 When Moses’ father-in-law saw all that Moses did for the people, he said, "What is this that you are doing for the people? Why do you sit alone and all the people stand about you from morning until evening?"

\s5
\v 15 Moses said to his father-in-law, "Because the people come to me to ask for God's direction.
\v 16 When they have a dispute, they come to me. I decide between a man and his neighbor, and I make them know the statutes of God and his laws."

\s5
\v 17 Moses’ father-in-law said to him, "What you are doing is not good.
\v 18 You will surely wear out both yourself and the people who are with you, for the burden is too heavy for you. You are not able to do it yourself alone.
\v 19 Listen to my voice. I will give you counsel, and God will be with you, for you are the people's  representative to God, and you bring their disputes to him.
\v 20 You must teach them the statutes and the laws, and show them the way in which they must walk and the work they must do.

\s5
\v 21 Furthermore, you must choose capable men from all the people, men who fear God, men of truth, hating unjust gain. You must place them over people to be rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.
\v 22 They will judge the people in all routine cases, but the difficult cases they will bring to you. As for every small case, they will judge it themselves so that it will be easier for you, and they will bear the burden with you.
\v 23 If you do this thing, and if God commands you to do so, then you will be able to endure, and all this people will be able to go home satisfied."

\s5
\v 24 So Moses listened to the voice of his father-in-law and did all that he had said.
\v 25 Then Moses chose capable men from all Israel and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.
\v 26 They judged the people in normal circumstances. The difficult cases they brought to Moses, but every small case they judged themselves.
\v 27 Then Moses let his father-in-law depart, and Jethro went his way back into his own land.





\s5
\c 19
\p
\v 1 In the third month after the people of Israel had gone out from the land of Egypt, on the same day, they came into the wilderness of Sinai.
\v 2 After they left Rephidim and came to the wilderness of Sinai, they camped in the wilderness, and Israel camped there in front of the mountain.

\s5
\v 3 Moses went up to God, and Yahweh called to him from the mountain, saying, "Thus shall you tell the house of Jacob, and tell the people of Israel:
\v 4 You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, how I carried you on eagles’ wings and brought you to myself.
\v 5 Now therefore, if you will obediently listen to my voice and keep my covenant, then you will be my special possession from among all peoples, for all the earth is mine.
\v 6 You will be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation. These are the words that you will speak to the people of Israel."

\s5
\p
\v 7 So Moses came and summoned for the elders of the people. He set before them all these words that Yahweh had commanded him.
\v 8 All the people answered together and said, "All that Yahweh has spoken we will do." Then Moses reported the words of the people to Yahweh.
\v 9 Yahweh said to Moses, "I am coming to you in a thick cloud so that the people may hear when I speak with you and may also believe you forever." Then Moses told the words of the people to Yahweh.

\s5
\v 10 Yahweh said to Moses, "Go to the people and sanctify them today and tomorrow, and make them wash their garments.
\v 11 Be ready for the third day, for the third day I, Yahweh, will come down upon Mount Sinai.

\s5
\v 12 You must set bounds all around the mountain for the people. Say to them, 'Take heed to yourselves, that you do not go up into the mountain or touch its border. Whoever touches the mountain will surely be put to death.
\v 13 No hand must touch him, but he will surely be stoned or shot through. Whether it be beast or man, he must be put to death. When the trumpet sounds a long blast, they must come up to the mountain."

\s5
\v 14 Then Moses went down from the mountain to the people. He sanctified the people, and they washed their garments.
\v 15 He said to the people, "Be ready on the third day; do not go near your wives."

\s5
\p
\v 16 On the third day, when it was morning, there were thunder and lightningbolts and a thick cloud on the mountain, and the sound of a very loud  horn. All the people in the camp trembled.
\v 17 Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet God, and they stood at the foot of the mountain.
\v 18 Mount Sinai was completely covered with smoke because Yahweh descended upon it in fire and  smoke.  The smoke ascended like the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mountain shook violently.

\s5
\v 19 When the voice of the horn grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him in a voice.
\v 20 Yahweh came down on Mount Sinai, to the top of the mountain, and he summoned Moses to the top of the mountain. Then Moses went up.
\v 21 Yahweh said to Moses, "Go down and warn the people not to break through to Yahweh to gaze, or many of them perish.
\v 22 Let the priests also who come near to Yahweh sanctify themselves lest Yahweh break forth against them."

\s5
\v 23 Moses said to Yahweh, "The people cannot come up to Mount Sinai, for you commanded us, saying, 'Set boundaries for the mountain and sanctify it.'"
\v 24 Yahweh said to him, "Go, get down the mountain, and bring up Aaron with you, but do not let the priests and the people break through to come up to Yahweh lest he break out  against them."
\v 25 So Moses went down to the people and spoke to them.





\s5
\c 20
\p
\v 1 God spoke all these words.
\v 2 "I am Yahweh, your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.
\v 3 You will have no other gods before me.

\s5
\p
\v 4 You will not make for yourself a carved figure nor any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water below.
\v 5 You will not bow down to them or serve them, for I, Yahweh your God, am a jealous God. I punish the ancestors' wickedness by bringing punishment on the children, to the third and the fourth generation of those who hate me,
\v 6 and showing covenant faithfulness to thousands of those who  love me and keep my commandments.

\s5
\p
\v 7 You will not take the name of Yahweh your God in vain, for Yahweh will not hold him guiltless that takes his name in vain.

\s5
\p
\v 8 Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.
\v 9 Six days will you labor and do all your work;
\v 10 but the seventh day is a Sabbath to Yahweh your God. In it you will not do any work, you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor your female servant, nor your cattle, nor the foreigner who is within your gates.
\v 11 For in six days Yahweh made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and then rested on the seventh day. Therefore Yahweh blessed the Sabbath day and consecrated it.

\s5
\p
\v 12 Honor your father and your mother so that you may live a long time in the land which Yahweh your God gives you.
\p
\v 13 You will not murder.
\p
\v 14 You will not commit adultery.

\s5
\p
\v 15 You will not steal.
\p
\v 16 You will not give false testimony against your neighbor.
\p
\v 17 You will not covet your neighbor’s house; you will not covet your neighbor’s wife, or his male servant, or his female servant, or his ox, or his donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor."

\s5
\p
\v 18 All the people saw the thundering and the lightning, and heard the voice of the trumpet, and saw the mountain smoking. When the people saw it, they trembled and stood far off.
\v 19 They said to Moses, "Speak to us, and we will listen; but do not let God speak to us, or we will die."
\v 20 Moses said to the people, "Do not fear, for God has come to test you so that the fear of him may be in you and so that you do not sin."
\v 21 So the people stood far off, and Moses approached the thick darkness where God was.

\s5
\p
\v 22 Yahweh said to Moses, "Thus you will tell the  Israelites, 'You yourselves have seen that I have talked with you from heaven.
\v 23 You will not make for yourselves other gods alongside me, gods of silver or gods of gold.

\s5
\v 24 An altar of earth you will make for me, and you will sacrifice on it your burnt offerings, your peace offerings, your sheep, and your oxen. In every place where I cause my name to be honored, I will come to you and bless you.
\v 25 If you make me an altar of stone, you will not build it of cut stones, for if you use your tool upon it, you will have defiled it.
\v 26 You must not go up by steps to my altar so that your nakedness is not exposed.





\s5
\c 21
\p
\v 1 "Now these are the decrees which you will set before them.

\s5
\p
\v 2 If you buy a Hebrew servant, he is to serve for six years, and in the seventh he will go free without paying anything.
\v 3 If he came by himself, he will go out by himself; if he is married, then his wife will go free with him.
\v 4 If his master gave him a wife and she bore him sons or daughters, the wife and her children will belong to her master, and he will go out by himself.

\s5
\v 5 But if the servant plainly says, 'I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free,'
\v 6 then his master will bring him to God, and then he will bring him to the door or to the doorpost, and his master will bore his ear through with an awl, and he will serve him forever.

\s5
\p
\v 7 If a man sells his daughter to be a female servant, she will not go out as the male servants do.
\v 8 If she does not please her master, who has designated her to himself, then he must let her be redeemed. He has no right to sell her to a foreign people. He will have no such right, seeing he has dealt deceitfully with her.

\s5
\v 9 If her master designates her as a wife for his son, he will treat her the same as if she were his daughter. 
\v 10 If he takes another wife for himself, he will not diminish her food, clothing, or her marital rights.
\v 11 But if he does not provide these three things for her, then she will go out free without paying money.

\s5
\p
\v 12 Whoever strikes a man so that he dies, that person shall surely be put to death.
\v 13 If a man did not do it with premeditation, but instead it happened by accident, then I will appoint a place where he may flee.
\v 14 If a man willfully attacks his neighbor to kill him deceitfully, then you will take him even from my altar, that he may die.

\s5
\p
\v 15 He who strikes his father or his mother will be surely put to death.
\p
\v 16 He who kidnaps a man and sells him, or the man is found in his possession, that kidnapper will surely be put to death.
\p
\v 17 He who curses his father or his mother will surely be put to death.

\s5
\p
\v 18 If men fight and one strikes the other with a stone or with his fist, and that person does not die, but is confined to his bed;
\v 19 then if he recovers and is able to walk about using his staff, then the man who struck him must pay for the loss of his time; he must also pay for his complete recovery. But that man is innocent of murder.

\s5
\p
\v 20 If a man strikes his male servant or his female servant with a staff, and if the servant dies as a result of the blow, then that man will surely be punished.
\v 21 However, if the servant lives for a day or two, the master will not be punished, for he will have suffered the loss of the servant.

\s5
\p
\v 22 If men fight together and hurt a pregnant woman so that she miscarries, but there is no other injury to her, then he will surely be fined, according as the woman’s husband's demands of him, and he shall pay as the judges determine.
\v 23 But if there is serious injury, then you will give a life for a life,
\v 24 an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a hand for a hand, a foot for a foot,
\v 25 a burn for a burn, a wound for a wound, or a bruise for a bruise.

\s5
\p
\v 26 If a man strikes the eye of his male servant or the eye of his female servant and destroys it, then he will let the servant go free in compensation for his eye.
\v 27 If he knocks out his male servant’s tooth or his female servant’s tooth, he will let the servant go free as compensation for the tooth.

\s5
\p
\v 28 If an ox gores a man or a woman to death, the ox will surely be stoned, and its flesh will not be eaten; but the owner of the ox will be aquitted of guilt.
\v 29 But if the ox had a habit of goring in the past, and its owner was warned and he did not keep it in, and the ox has killed a man or a woman, that ox will be stoned, and its owner also must be put to death.
\v 30 If a ransom is required from him, he will pay whatever he is required to pay.

\s5
\v 31 If it has gored a son or a daughter, the owner will do what this decree requires him to do.  
\v 32 If the ox gores a male servant or a female servant, the owner must pay thirty shekels of silver, and the ox must be stoned.

\s5
\p
\v 33 If a man opens a pit, or if a man digs a pit and does not cover it, and an ox or an donkey falls into it,
\v 34 the owner of the pit must repay the loss. He must give money to the owner of the dead animal, and the dead animal will become his.

\s5
\p
\v 35 If one man’s ox hurt another man's ox so that it dies, then they will sell the live ox and divide its price, and they will also divide the dead ox.
\v 36 But if it was known that the ox had a habit of goring in time past, and its owner has not kept it in, he will surely pay ox for ox, and the dead animal shall be his own."





\s5
\c 22
\p
\v 1 If a man steals an ox or a sheep and kills it or sells it, then he will pay five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep.
\v 2 If the thief is found breaking in, and if he is struck so that he dies, there will be no bloodguilt for him.
\v 3 If the sun has risen on him, there is bloodguilt for him; 

\s5
\p
A thief will make restitution. If he has nothing, then he will be sold for his theft.
\v 4 If the stolen animal is found alive in his possession, whether it be an ox, a donkey, or a sheep, he must pay back double.
\p
\v 5 If a man grazes his livestock in a field or vineyard and lets his animal loose, and it grazes in another man’s field, he must make restitution from the best of his own field and from the best of his own vineyard.

\s5
\p
\v 6 If a fire breaks out and spreads in thorns so that the stacked grain, or the standing grain, or the field is consumed, he who kindled the fire will surely make restitution.

\s5
\p
\v 7 If a man gives money or goods to his neighbor for safe keeping, and if it is stolen out of the man’s house, if the thief is found, he will pay double.
\v 8 But if the thief is not found, then the owner of the house will come before the judges to see whether he has laid his hand on his neighbor’s property.
\v 9 For every case of dishonest appropriation, whether it is for an ox,  an ass, or a sheep, or for clothing, or for any other lost thing about which one says, 'This belongs to me,' the claim of  both parties will come before the judges. The man whom the judges find guilty will pay double to his neighbor.

\s5
\p
\v 10 If a man gives his neighbor a donkey, an ox, a sheep, or any animal to keep, and if it dies or is hurt or is carried away without anyone seeing it,
\v 11 the oath of the Lord will be between them both, whether or not he has put his hand on his neighbor’s property. The owner will accept this, and he will not make restitution.
\v 12 But if it was stolen from him, he will make restitution to the owner for it.
\v 13 If it was torn in pieces, let him bring it for evidence: he will not have to pay for what was torn.

\s5
\p
\v 14 If a man borrows any animal from his neighbor and it is injured or dies, the owner not being with it, he will surely make restitution.
\v 15 But if the owner was with it, he will not have to pay; if it was something hired, it came for its hiring fee.

\s5
\p
\v 16 If a man seduces a virgin who is not engaged, and if he sleeps with her, he will surely make her his wife by paying the bride price for her to be his wife.
\v 17 If her father utterly refuses to give her to him, he will pay money equal to the bride price of virgins.

\s5
\p
\v 18 You will not allow a sorceress to live.
\p
\v 19 Whosoever has sexual relations with a beast will surely be put to death.

\s5
\p
\v 20 He that sacrifices to any god except to Yahweh will be utterly destroyed.
\v 21 You will not wrong a foreigner or oppress him, for you were foreigners in the land of Egypt.

\s5
\v 22 You will not mistreat any widow or fatherless child.
\v 23 If you afflict them at all, and if they cry at all to me, I will surely hear their cry.
\v 24 My anger will burn, and I will kill you with the sword; your wives will be widows, and your children will be fatherless.

\s5
\p
\v 25 If you lend money to any of my people among you who are poor, you will not be like a moneylender to him or charge him interest.
\v 26 If you take your neighbor’s garment in pledge, you must return it to him before the sun goes down,
\v 27 for that is his only covering; it is his garment for his body. What else can he sleep in? When he cries to me, I will hear, for I am gracious.

\s5
\p
\v 28 You will not blaspheme God nor curse a ruler of your people.

\s5
\v 29 You will not hold back offerings from your harvest and of the outflow of your wine presses. The firstborn of your sons you will give to me.
\v 30 You must also do this with your oxen and your sheep. For seven days they may remain with their mothers, but on the eighth day you will give them to me.
\v 31 You will be holy people to me. Therefore you must not eat any meat that was torn by animals in the field. Instead, you will throw it to the dogs.





\s5
\c 23
\p
\v 1 You must not make a false report. Do not join hands with a wicked man to be an unrighteous witness.
\v 2 You must not follow a crowd to do evil, nor will you bear witness, siding with the crowd to pervert justice.
\v 3 You will not favor a poor man in his lawsuit.

\s5
\p
\v 4 If you meet your enemy’s ox or his donkey going astray, you must  bring it back to him again.
\v 5 If you see the donkey of someone who hates you lying under his load, you must not leave him. You will surely help him with it.

\s5
\p
\v 6 You must not pervert justice that should go to your poor people in a poor man's lawsuit.
\v 7 Keep away from a false charge, and do not kill the innocent and righteous, for I will not acquit the wicked.
\v 8 Never take a bribe, for a bribe blinds those who see, and perverts the words of the righteous.
\v 9 You will not oppress a foreigner, since you know the heart of a foreigner, seeing you were foreigners in the land of Egypt.

\s5
\p
\v 10 For six years you will sow your land and gather in its produce.
\v 11 But in the seventh year you will leave it unplowed and fallow so that the poor of your people may eat. What they leave, the animals of the field will eat.  You will deal likewise with your vineyard and olive grove.

\s5
\v 12 In six days you will do your work, but on the seventh day you must rest so that your ox and your donkey may have rest and so that your female servant's son and any hired help may rest and be refreshed.
\v 13 Pay attention to all that I have said to you. Do not mention the names of other gods, nor let their names be heard from your mouth.

\s5
\p
\v 14 Three times you will make a pilgrim feast to me in the year.
\v 15 You are to observe the Festival of Unleavened Bread.  As I commanded you, seven days you will eat unleavened bread. At that time,  you will appear before me in the appointed month Abib, for in it you came out from Egypt.  But you will not appear before me empty handed.

\s5
\v 16 You will observe the Festival of Harvest, the first fruits of your labors which you sowed in the field. Also you will observe the Festival of Ingathering at the end of the year when you gather in your produce from the field.
\v 17 Three times in the year all your men will appear before Yahweh.

\s5
\p
\v 18 You will not offer the blood of my sacrifice with bread containing yeast. The fat of my feast will not remain all night until the morning.
\v 19 The most choice of the first fruits of your ground you will bring into the house of Yahweh your God. You will not boil a young goat in its mother’s milk.

\s5
\p
\v 20 I am going to send an angel before you to guard you on the way and to bring you to the place that I have prepared.
\v 21 Be attentive to him and obey him. Do not provoke him, for he will not pardon your transgressions. My name is in him.
\v 22 If you will indeed obey his voice and do all that I say, then I will be an enemy to your enemies and an adversary to your adversaries.

\s5
\v 23 My angel will go before you and bring you to the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Canaanites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites.  I will cut them off.
\v 24 You must not bow down to their gods nor serve them nor do as they do.  But you will utterly overthrow them and smash in pieces their sacred stone pillars.
\v 25 You must serve Yahweh your God, and he will bless your bread and your water. I will remove sickness from among you.

\s5
\v 26 No woman will be barren or miscarry her young in your land. I will fulfill the number of your days.
\v 27 I will send my terror before you. I will kill all the people whom you encounter. I will make all your enemies turn their backs to you.
\v 28 I will send hornets before you which will drive out the Hivites, the Canaanites, and the Hittites, from before you.
\v 29 I will not drive them out from before you in one year so that the land does not become desolate and the animals of the field multiply against you.

\s5
\v 30 Little by little I will drive them out from before you until you become fruitful and inherit the land.
\v 31 I will fix your border from the Red Sea to the sea of the Philistines, and from the wilderness to the River. I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hands. You will drive them out before you.
\v 32 You must not make a covenant with them nor with their gods.
\v 33 They must not live in your land so that they do not make you sin against me.  If you worship their gods, it will surely be a trap to you.





\s5
\c 24
\p
\v 1 Then he said to Moses, "Come up to Yahweh, you, Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel, and worship from a distance.
\v 2 Moses alone may come near to Yahweh. The others must not come near, nor may the people come up with him."

\s5
\v 3 Moses came and told the people all the words of Yahweh and all the decrees. All the people answered with one voice and said, "All the words that Yahweh has said, we will do."
\v 4 Then Moses wrote down all the words of Yahweh.  

\s5
\p
Early in the morning, Moses built an altar at the foot the mountain and arranged twelve stone pillars, ordering the stones to represent each of twelve tribes of Israel.
\v 5 He sent young men of the Israelites, who offered burnt offerings and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen to Yahweh.
\v 6 Moses took half of the blood and put it in basins; half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar.

\s5
\v 7 He took the book of the covenant and read it aloud to the people. They said, "All that Yahweh has spoken we will do, and we will be obedient."
\v 8 Then Moses took the blood and sprinkled it on the people. He said, "This is the blood of the covenant that Yahweh has made with you by giving you this promise with all these words."

\s5
\p
\v 9 Then Moses, Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel went up the mountain.
\v 10 They saw the God of Israel. Under his feet there was a pavement of sapphire stone, as clear as the sky itself.
\v 11 God did not lay a hand upon the leaders of the Israelites. They saw God and ate and drank.

\s5
\p
\v 12 Yahweh said to Moses, "Come up to me on the mountain and remain there. I will give you the tables of stone and the law and the commandments, which I have written, that you may teach them."
\v 13 So Moses set out with Joshua, his assistant, and Moses went up into the mountain of God.

\s5
\v 14 He said to the elders, "Stay here and wait for us until we come again to you. Aaron and Hur are with you. If anyone has a dispute, let him come to them."
\v 15 So Moses went up onto the mountain, and the cloud covered the mountain.

\s5
\v 16 The glory of Yahweh settled upon Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it for six days. On the seventh day he called to Moses from within the cloud.
\v 17 The appearance of the glory of Yahweh was like a devouring fire on the top of the mountain in the eyes of the Israelites.
\v 18 Moses entered into the cloud and went up onto the mountain. Moses was in the mountain for forty days and forty nights.





\s5
\c 25
\p
\v 1 Yahweh said to Moses,
\v 2 "Tell the Israelites to take an offering for me from every man motivated by a willing heart. From these you will take my offering.

\s5
\v 3 This is the offering which you will receive from them: gold, silver, brass,
\v 4 blue and purple and scarlet dyes,  fine linen, goats’ hair,
\v 5 rams’ skins dyed red, fine leather, acacia wood,
\v 6 oil for the light, spices for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense,
\v 7 onyx stones, and stones to be set for the ephod and breastpiece.

\s5
\v 8 Let them make me a sanctuary so that I may live among them.
\v 9 Exactly as I show you regarding the pattern of the tabernacle and the pattern of all its equipment, just like that you must make it.

\s5
\p
\v 10 They are to make an ark of acacia wood; its length will be two and a half cubits, its width will be one cubit and a half, and its  height will be one cubit and a half.
\v 11 You will cover it inside and outside with pure gold, and make a border of gold around the top of it.

\s5
\v 12 You will cast four rings of gold for it, and put them on its four feet, with two rings on one side, and two rings on the other side of it.
\v 13 You will make poles of acacia wood and cover them with gold.
\v 14 You will put the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark, to carry the ark by them.

\s5
\v 15 The poles will remain in the rings of the ark; they will not be taken from it.
\v 16 You will put into the ark the testimony which I will give you.
\v 17 You will make an atonement lid of pure gold. Its length will be two and a half cubits, and its width will be a cubit and a half.
\v 18 You will make two cherubim of hammered gold at the two ends of the atonement lid.

\s5
\v 19 Make one cherub for one end, and one cherub for the other end, being one piece with the atonement lid.
\v 20 The cherubim will spread out their wings upward, overshadowing the atonement lid with their wings, facing one another and  looking toward the atonement lid.
\v 21 You will put the atonement lid on top of the ark, and in the ark you will put the testimony that I am giving you.

\s5
\v 22 There I will meet with you, and I will speak with you from above the atonement lid. From between the two cherubim
that are over the ark of the testimony I will speak to you about all things that I will command you for the Israelites.

\s5
\p
\v 23 You will make a table of acacia wood; its length will be two cubits, and its width will be one cubit, and its height will be a cubit and a half.
\v 24 You will cover it with pure gold and with a border of gold around the top.

\s5
\v 25 You will make a surrounding frame for it about one handbreadth wide and a golden crown for its border.
\v 26 You will make for it four rings of gold, and attach the rings on the four corners that are on its four feet.
\v 27 The rings will be close to the frame to provide places for the poles to carry the table.

\s5
\v 28 You will make the poles of acacia wood and cover them with gold so that the table may be be carried with them.
\v 29 You will make the dishes, spoons, pitchers, and bowls used to pour out drink offerings.
You will make them of pure gold.
\v 30 You will regularly set the bread of the presence on the table before me.

\s5
\p
\v 31 You will make a lampstand of pure gold. The lampstand is to be made of hammered metal with its base and its shaft; its cups, its buds, and its flowers are to be all of one piece.
\v 32 There will be six branches going out of its sides---three branches of the candlestick out of one side, and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side.

\s5
\v 33 One branch will have three cups made like almond-blossoms with a bud and a flower, and three cups made like almond-blossoms in the other branch, with a bud and a flower. It will be the same for the six branches coming out of the candlestick.
\v 34 In the candlestick there will be four cups made like almond-blossoms with the buds and the flowers.

\s5
\v 35 There will be a bud under the first pair of branches of one piece of it, and a bud under the second pair of branches of one piece of it, and a bud under the third pair of branches of one piece of it, for the six branches going out of the candlestick.
\v 36 Their buds and their branches will be one piece with it, one beaten work of pure gold.

\s5
\v 37 You will make it with seven lamps, and they will light the lamps to give light from it.
\v 38 The tongs and their trays will be of pure gold.
\v 39 Use one talent of pure gold to make the lampstand and utensils.
\v 40 Be sure to make them after the pattern that you are being shown on the mountain.





\s5
\c 26

\v 6 You will make fifty clasps of gold and couple the curtains one to another with the clasps so that the tabernacle will be one whole.

\s5
\p
\v 7 You will make curtains of goats’ hair for a tent over the tabernacle, and you will make eleven curtains. 
\v 8 The length of each curtain will be thirty cubits, and the width of each curtain will four cubits for all of  the eleven curtains.

\v 11 You will make fifty clasps of bronze and put the clasps into the loops and couple the tent together, so that it may be one.

\s5
\v 12 As the overhanging part that remains of the curtains of the tent, the half curtain that remains will hang over the back of the tabernacle.
\v 13 The one cubit of curtain on the one side, and the one cubit of curtain on the other side—that which remains of the length of the tent's curtains will hang over the sides of the tabernacle on one side and on the other side, to cover it.
\v 14 You will make a covering for the tent of rams’ skins dyed red, and a covering of fine leather above.

\s5
\v 19 You will make forty bases of silver under the twenty boards. There will be two bases under each board for its two pedestals, and two bases under another board for its two pedestals.

\v 21 and their forty bases of silver. There will be two bases under one board, and two bases under the next board.

\s5
\v 22 For the back side of the tabernacle on the west side you will make six boards.
\v 23 You will make two boards for the corners of the tabernacle on the back.
\v 24 These will be separate at the bottom, but joined at the top to one ring. So it will it be for both corners.
\v 25 There will be eight boards and their bases of silver, sixteen bases. There will be two bases under one board and two sockets under the next board.

\s5
\p
\v 26 You will make bars of acacia wood—five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle,
\v 27 five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards for the back side of the tabernacle to the west.
\v 28 The middle bar in the center of the boards will reach from end to end.

\s5
\v 29 You will cover the boards with gold and make their rings of gold for the holders of the bars, and you will cover the bars with gold.
\v 30 You will set up the tabernacle by following the plan  you were shown on the mountain.

\s5

\v 32 You will hang it upon four pillars of acacia covered with gold. They will be with hooks of gold upon four bases of silver.
\v 33 You will hang up the curtain under the clasps, and you will bring in the ark of the testimony . The curtain is to separate  the holy place from the most holy place. 

\s5
\v 34 You will put the atonement lid on the ark of the testimony in the most holy place.
\v 35 You will set the table outside the curtain. You will set the lampstand opposite the table on the south side of the tabernacle. The table will be on the north side.

\s5
\p
\v 36 You will make a hanging for the entrance of the tent of blue, purple, and scarlet, using fine twined linen, the work of the embroiderer.
\v 37 You will make for the hanging five posts of acacia and cover them with gold. Their hooks will be of gold, and you will cast five bronze bases for them.

\c 27
\p
\v 1 You will make the altar of acacia wood, five cubits long and five cubits wide. The altar will be square, and its height will be three cubits.
\v 2 You will make horns on its four corners. The horns will be one piece with it, and you will overlay it with bronze.

\s5
\v 5 You will put the grating under the ledge of the altar below so the network comes halfway up the altar.

\s5
\v 7 The poles will be put into the rings, and the poles will be on the two sides of the altar, for carrying it.
\v 8 You will make the altar hollow, out of planks. As it has been shown you on the mountain, thus you will make it.

\s5
\p
\v 9 You will make a courtyard for the tabernacle. On the south side there will be hangings for the court of fine twined linen one hundred cubits long
\v 10 with twenty posts, their twenty bases of bronze, the hooks of the posts, and their rods of silver.

\v 20 You will command the Israelites to bring to you pure olive oil of pressed olives for the lights so that the lights may burn continually.
\v 21 In the tent of meeting, outside the curtain that is before the testimony, Aaron and his sons will maintain the lamps from evening to morning before the Lord. This requirement will be a lasting ordinance forever throughout their generations for the Israelite nation.





\s5
\c 28
\p
\v 1 Bring near to you Aaron your brother and his sons [Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar] from among the Israelites so that they may minister to me as priests, together with Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar, Aaron’s sons.
\v 2 You will make holy garments for Aaron, your brother, for honor and for beauty.
\v 3 You will speak to all who are specially skilled, those whom I have filled with the spirit of wisdom, so that they may make Aaron’s garments to consecrate him to serve me as my priest.

\s5
\v 4 The garments which they will make are a breastpiece, an ephod, a robe, a coat of checkered work, a turban, and a sash. They will make holy garments for your brother Aaron and his sons so that they may serve me as priests.
\v 5 Artisans will use gold, blue, purple, scarlet, and fine linen.

\s5
\p
\v 6 They will make the ephod of gold, blue, purple, scarlet, and fine twined linen, the work of the skillful workman.
\v 7 It will have two shoulder pieces attached to two of its corners.
\v 8 Like the ephod will be its skillfully woven waistband; it will be of one piece with the ephod, made of gold, blue, purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.
\v 9 You will take two onyx stones and engrave on them the names of the sons of Israel.

\s5
\v 10 Six of their names will be on one stone, and six names will be on the other stone, in order of the son's birth.
\v 11 With the work of an engraver in stone, like the engraving of a signet ring, you will engrave the two stones with the names of the people of Israel. You will mount the stones in settings of gold.
\v 12 You will put the two stones on the shoulder pieces of the ephod, to be stones to memorialize the sons of Israel. Aaron will bear their names before Yahweh on his two shoulders as a memorial.

\s5
\v 13 You will make settings of gold
\v 14 and two braided chains of pure gold like a cord, and you will attach the chains to the settings.

\s5
\p
\v 15 You will make a breastpiece for decision making, the work of a skillful workman, fashioned like the ephod, made of gold, blue, purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.

\s5
\v 21 The stones will be set up by the names of the tribes of Israel, twelve stones set up in the order of their names; they will be like the engravings of a seal, every one according to his own name. The stones will stand for all the twelve tribes.
\v 22 You will make on the breastpiece braided chains like cords of pure gold.
\v 23 You will make two rings of gold for the breastpiece and will attach two rings on the two ends of the breastplate.
\v 24 You will put the two golden chains in the two rings at the ends of the breastpiece.

\s5
\v 25 The other two ends of the golden chains you will attach to the two settings, and then you will attach them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod at the front.
\v 26 You will make two rings of gold, and you will put them on the other two ends of the breastpiece, on the edge that is toward the inner side of the ephod.

\s5
\v 27 You will make two more gold rings, and you will attach them to the bottom of the two shoulder pieces of the front of ephod, close to its seam above the skillfully woven band of the ephod.
\v 28 They will bind the breastpiece by its rings to the ephod's rings with a blue cord, for it to lie just above the ephod's woven band so that the breastplate will not be separated from the ephod.

\s5
\v 29 When Aaron goes into the holy place, he will bear the names of the sons of Israel in the breastpiece for decision making upon his heart as a continual memorial before Yahweh.
\v 30 You will put in the breastpiece for decision making the Urim and the Thummim. They will be upon Aaron’s heart when he goes in before Yahweh, and Aaron will bear the decision making of the Israelites on his heart before the Lord continually.

\s5
\p
\v 31 You will make the robe of the ephod completely of blue.
\v 32 It will have an opening for the head in the middle of it with a woven edge around its opening so that it does not tear.

\s5
\v 33 On the bottom hem you will make pomegranates of blue, of purple, and of scarlet yarn with bells of gold between the pomegranates all around.
\v 34 There will be a golden bell and a pomegranate, a golden bell and a pomegranate all around the hem of the robe.
\v 35 The robe is to be on Aaron when he serves so that the sound can be heard when he goes into the holy place before Yahweh and when he leaves so that he does not die.

\s5
\p
\v 36 You will make a plate of pure gold and engrave on it, like the engraving of a seal, HOLY TO YAHWEH.
\v 37 You will attach to the turban a blue cord which will be on the front of the turban.
\v 38 It will be on Aaron’s forehead, and Aaron will always bear the iniquity of the holy things which the Israelites will sanctify by all their holy gifts; it will be always on his forehead for their acceptability to Yahweh.

\s5
\v 39 You will weave the coat of checkered work of fine linen, and you will make a turban of fine linen, and you will make a sash, the work of the embroiderer.

\s5
\p
\v 40 For Aaron’s sons you will make coats, sashes, and headbands for honor and for beauty.
\v 41 You will clothe Aaron your brother, and his sons with him; and you will anoint and consecrate them. You will consecrate them so that they may serve me as priests.

\s5
\v 42 You will make them linen undergarments to cover their nakedness, undergarments that will cover them from the waist to the thighs.
\v 43 Aaron and his sons will wear these when they enter the tent of meeting or when they approach  the altar to serve in the holy place so that they may bear no iniquity and die. This will be an ordinance forever to Aaron and to his descendants after him.





\s5
\c 29
\p
\v 1 Now this is what you must do to consecrate them so that they may serve me as priests. Take one young bull and two rams without blemish,
\v 2 bread without yeast, and cakes without yeast mingled with oil. Take also wafers without yeast anointed with oil. Make the wafers using fine white flour.

\s5
\v 3 You will put them into a single basket, bring them in the basket, and present them with the bull and the two rams.
\v 4 You will present Aaron and his sons at the entrance of the tent of meeting. You will wash them with water.

\s5
\v 5 You will take the garments and clothe Aaron with the coat, the robe of the ephod, the ephod, and the breastpiece, fastening the skillfully woven band of the ephod around him.
\v 6 You will set the turban on his head and put the holy crown upon the turban.
\v 7 Then take the anointing oil and pour it on his head, and thus anoint him.

\s5
\v 8 You will bring his sons and put coats on them.
\v 9 You will clothe Aaron and his sons with sashes and will put headbands on them. The service of the priesthood will belong to them by a perpetual ordinance. Thus you will consecrate Aaron and his sons.

\s5
\p
\v 10 You will all bring the bull before the tent of meeting, and Aaron and his sons will lay their hands upon its head.
\v 11 You will kill the bull before Yahweh at the door of the tent of meeting.

\s5
\v 12 You will take some of the bull's blood and put it upon the horns of the altar with your finger, and you will  pour out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar.
\v 13 You will take all the fat that covers the innards, and also take the covering of the liver and the  two kidneys with the fat that is upon them; burn it all on the altar.
\v 14 But the bull's flesh, as well as its skin and dung, you will burn up outside the camp. It will be a sin offering.

\s5
\p
\v 15 You will also take the one ram, and Aaron and his sons will lay their hands upon its head.
\v 16 You will kill the ram. Then take its blood and sprinkle it round about and on the altar.
\v 17 You will cut the ram into pieces and wash its inner parts and its legs, and you will put them together with its pieces and with its head
\v 18 on the altar. Then burn the whole ram. It will be a burnt offering to Yahweh, an aroma that will be sweet to him, an offering made by fire to him.

\s5
\p
\v 19 You will then take the other ram, and Aaron and his sons will lay their hands upon its head.
\v 20 Then you will kill the ram and take some of its blood. Put it on the tip of Aaron's right ear, and on the tip of his sons' right ears, on the thumb of their right hands, and on the great toe of their right feet. Then you will sprinkle the blood on the altar round about.

\s5
\v 21 You will take some of the blood that is on the altar and some of the anointing oil, and sprinkle it all on Aaron and on his garments, and also on his sons and on their garments. Aaron will then be consecrated to me, as well as his garments, his sons and his sons’ garments with him.

\s5
\v 22 You will take the ram's fat, the fat tail, the fat that covers the inner parts, the covering of the liver, the two kidneys and the fat on them, and the right thigh—for this ram is one of consecration.
\v 23 Take one loaf of bread, one cake of bread made with oil, and one wafer out of the basket of bread without yeast that is before Yahweh.

\s5
\v 24 You will put these in Aaron's hands and in the hands of his sons. They will raise them up before Yahweh and present them as an offering to him.
\v 25 You will then take the food from their hands and burn it on the altar with the burnt offering as an aroma sweet to Yahweh. It will be an offering made by fire to him.

\s5
\p
\v 26 You will take the breast of Aaron’s ram of consecration and raise it up and present it as an offering to Yahweh. Then it will be your portion to eat.
\v 27 You will consecrate the breast of the offering that must be raised high and the thigh of the offering that must be presented—the breast that is raised and the thigh that is presented, both coming from the ram of consecration of Aaron and his sons.
\v 28 These will be the portions forever for Aaron and his sons from the Israelites. By the regulations for the fellowship offerings, these will be presented offerings for the priests taken from the Israelites' offerings presented to Yahweh.

\s5
\v 29 The holy garments of Aaron will also be reserved for his sons after him. They are to be anointed in them and consecrated in them.
\v 30 The priest who succeeds him from among his sons, who comes into the tent of meeting to serve in the holy place, is to wear those garments for seven days.

\s5
\p
\v 31 You will take the ram of consecration and boil its meat in a holy place.
\v 32 Aaron and his sons will eat the ram's meat and the bread that is in the basket at the door of the tent of meeting.
\v 33 They will eat those things that were used to atone for them and to consecrate them to serve me. No one else will eat them because they are consecrated to them.
\v 34 If any of the meat of the consecration offering or any of the bread remains to the next morning, then you will burn it. It must not be eaten because it is consecrated.

\s5
\p
\v 35 Thus you will do to Aaron and to his sons by following all that I have commanded you to do.. You will consecrate them for seven days.
\v 36 Every day you will offer a bull for a sin offering for atonement. You will purify the altar by making atonement for it, and you will anoint it to set it apart as holy. 
\v 37 For seven days you will make atonement for the altar and consecrate it. Then the altar will be most holy. Whatever touches the altar will be holy.

\s5
\p
\v 38 Now you will regularly offer on the altar every day two lambs a year old.
\v 39 One lamb you will offer in the morning, and the other lamb you will offer about sundown.

\s5
\v 40 With the first lamb, offer a tenth part of an ephah of fine flour mingled with the fourth part of a hin of oil from pressed olives, and the fourth part of a hin of wine as a drink offering.

\s5
\v 41 The second lamb you will offer about sunset, and you will offer the same grain offering as in the morning, and the same drink offering. These will give a sweet aroma, an offering made by fire to Yahweh.
\v 42 This will be a regular burnt offering throughout your generations at the door of the tent of meeting before Yahweh where I will meet with you to speak to you.

\s5
\v 43 There I will meet with the Israelites; the tent will be consecrated by my glory.
\v 44  I will consecrate the tent of meeting and the altar. Also Aaron and his sons I will consecrate to serve me  as priests.

\s5
\v 45 I will live among the Israelites and will be their God.
\v 46 They will know that I am Yahweh, their God, who brought them out of the land of Egypt so that I might live among them. I am Yahweh, their God.





\s5
\c 30
\p
\v 1 "You will make an altar to burn incense. You will make it of acacia wood.
\v 2 Its length will be one cubit, and its width one cubit. It will be square, and its height will be two cubits. Its horns will be of one piece with it.

\s5
\v 3 You will cover the incense altar with pure gold—its top, its sides, and its horns. You will make a surrounding border of gold for it.
\v 4 You will make two golden rings to be attached to it under its border on its two opposite sides. The rings will be holders for poles to carry the altar.

\s5
\v 5 You will make the poles of acacia wood and you will cover them with gold.
\v 6 You will put the incense altar before the curtain that is by the ark of the testimony, before the atonement lid that is over the testimony, where I will meet with you.

\s5
\v 7 Aaron will burn fragrant  incense every morning; when he tends the lamps, he will burn it.
\v 8 When Aaron lights the lamps again in the evening, he will burn incense on the altar, a regular burning of incense before the Lord throughout your generations.
\v 9 But you will offer no other incense on it nor any burnt offering or grain offering. You will pour no drink offering on it.

\s5
\v 10 Aaron will make atonement on the horns of the incense altar once a year with the blood of the sin offering of atonement throughout your generations. It is most holy to Yahweh."

\s5
\p
\v 11 Yahweh spoke to Moses,
\v 12 "When you take a census of the Israelites, then each will give a ransom for his life to Yahweh. This you will do when you count them so that there will be no plague among them, when you count them.
\v 13 Everyone who is counted in the census is to pay half a shekel of silver, according to the weight of the shekel of the sanctuary (the shekel is twenty gerahs). This half a shekel is for an offering to Yahweh.
\v 14 Everyone who is counted, from twenty years old and up, will give this offering to Yahweh.

\s5
\v 15 When they give this offering to Yahweh to make atonement for their lives, the rich will not give more than the half shekel, and the poor will not give less.
\v 16 You will receive the atonement money from the Israelites and will allocate it to the service of the tent of meeting. It will be a memorial for the Israelites before Yahweh, to make atonement for your souls."

\s5
\p
\v 17 Yahweh spoke to Moses, 
\v 18 "You will also make a large bronze basin with a bronze stand, a basin for  washing. You will put it between the tent of meeting and the altar, and you will put water in it.

\s5
\v 19 Aaron and his sons will wash their hands and their feet out of it.
\v 20 When they go into the tent of meeting or when they go near to the altar to serve Yahweh in burning an offering made by fire, they will wash with water so that they do not die.
\v 21 They will wash their hands and their feet so that they do not die. This will  be an ordinance forever for Aaron and his descendants throughout their generations."

\s5
\p
\v 22 Yahweh spoke to Moses, 
\v 23 "Take these fine spices: 500 shekels of flowing myrrh, 250 shekels of sweet-smelling cinnamon, 250 shekels of sweet-smelling cane,
\v 24 500 shekels of cassia, measured by the weight of the shekel of the sanctuary, and one hin of olive oil.
\v 25 With these ingredients you will make a holy anointing oil, blended by a perfumer. It will be a holy anointing oil.

\s5
\v 26 With this oil you will anoint the tent of meeting, the ark of the testimony,
\v 27 the table and all its utensils, the lampstand and its utensils, the altar of incense,
\v 28 the altar of burnt offering with all the utensils, and the basin with its stand.

\s5
\v 29 You will consecrate them so that they may be most holy, and anything that touches them will also be consecrated.
\v 30 You will anoint Aaron and his sons and consecrate them so that they may serve me as priests.
\v 31 You will say to the Israelites, 'This will be a anointing oil consecrated to me throughout your generations.

\s5
\v 32 It will not be applied to the flesh of people, nor will you make any oil like it with the same formula because it is consecrated, and it will be holy to you.
\v 33 Whosoever makes perfume like it, or whoever puts any of it on someone, that person will be cut off from his people.'"

\s5
\p
\v 34 Yahweh said to Moses, "Take spices---stacte, and onycha, and galbanum—sweet spices along with pure frankincense, each of equal amounts,
\v 35 and make it into a sort of incense, blended by the perfumer, seasoned with salt, pure and holy.
\v 36 It is to be finely ground. Put some of it in front of the ark of testimony in the tent of meeting where I will meet with you. It will be regarded by you as holy to me.

\s5
\v 37 The incense that you will make, you will not make any with the same formula for yourselves. It will be holy in your sight to Yahweh.
\v 38 Whoever makes anything like it to use as a perfume will be cut off from his people."





\s5
\c 31
\p
\v 1 Yahweh spoke to Moses,
\v 2 "See, I have chosen Bezalel, the son of Uri, the son of Hur, from the tribe of Judah.

\s5
\v 3  I have filled him with the spirit of God for wisdom, for understanding,  for knowledge, and for all kinds of craftsmanship,
\v 4 to devise artistic designs and to work in gold, silver, and bronze;
\v 5 also to cut and set stones and to carve wood—to work in all kinds of craftsmanship.

\s5
\v 6 In addition, with him I have appointed Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, from the tribe of Dan. In the heart of all who are wise-hearted I have put wisdom so that they may make all that I have commanded you. This includes:
\v 7 the tent of meeting, the ark of the testimony, the atonement lid on the ark, and all the furniture of the tent---
\v 8 the table and its utensils, the pure candlestick with all its utensils, the altar of incense,
\v 9 the altar of burnt offering with all its vessels, and the large basin with its base.

\s5
\v 10 This also includes the finely woven garments—the holy garments for Aaron the priest and those of his sons so that they may serve as priests.
\v 11 This also includes the anointing oil and the sweet incense for the holy place. These craftsmen will make all these things just as I have commanded you."

\s5
\p
\v 12 Yahweh spoke to Moses, 
\v 13 "Tell the Israelites, you must certainly keep my Sabbath days, for these will be a sign between me and you throughout your generations so that you may know that I am Yahweh, who sets you apart.
\v 14 You shall therefore keep the Sabbath, for it is holy to you. Everyone who defiles it shall surely be put to death; anyone who works on the Sabbath shall surely be cut off from his people.
\v 15 Six days may work be done, but the seventh day is a Sabbath of complete rest, holy to Yahweh. Whoever does any work on the Sabbath day shall surely be put to death.

\s5
\v 16 Therefore the Israelites will keep the Sabbath; they will observe it throughout their generations as a perpetual requirement.
\v 17 It is a sign between me and the Israelites forever, for in six days Yahweh made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested and was refreshed."

\s5
\p
\v 18 When God had finished communing with Moses on Mount Sinai, he gave him two tablets of testimony, made of stone, written on by the hand of God.





\s5
\c 32
\p
\v 1 When the people saw that Moses delayed in coming down from the mountain, they gathered around Aaron and said to him, "Come, make us gods who will go before us. As for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him."
\v 2 Aaron said to them, "Take off the golden rings that are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them to me."

\s5
\v 3 All the people took off the golden rings that were in their ears and brought them to Aaron.
\v 4 He received the gold from them, fashioned it with a mold, and made it into a molten calf. The people said, "These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt."

\s5
\v 5 When Aaron saw this, he built an altar before the calf and made a proclamation, saying, "Tomorrow will be a festival for Yahweh."
\v 6 The people arose early the next day and offered burnt offerings and brought fellowship offerings. Then people sat down to eat and to drink and rose up to celebrate.

\s5
\p
\v 7 Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, "Go quickly, for your people, whom you brought up out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves.
\v 8 They have quickly turned aside from the way that I commanded them. They have made for themselves a molten calf and have worshiped it, and have sacrificed to it. They have said, "These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt."

\s5
\v 9 Then Yahweh said to Moses, "I have seen this people. Look, they are a stiff-necked people.
\v 10 Now therefore let me alone so that my anger may burn hot against them and so that I may destroy them. Then I will make of you a great nation."
\v 11 But Moses sought the favor of Yahweh his God and said, "O Yahweh, why does your anger burn against your people, whom you have brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand?

\s5
\v 12 Why should the Egyptians say, 'For evil he led them out, to kill them in the mountains and to destroy them from the face of the earth?' Turn from your burning anger and relent of this evil against your people.
\v 13 Remember Abraham and Isaac and Israel, your servants, to whom you swore by your own self and said to them, 'I will multiply your descendants as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of I will give to your descendants. They will inherit it forever.'"
\v 14 Then Yahweh relented of the evil that he said he would do to his people.

\s5
\p
\v 15 Then Moses turned and went down from the mountain, carrying the two tablets of the testimony in his hand. The tablets were written on both their sides, on both the front and the back.
\v 16 The tablets were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, engraved upon the tablets.

\s5
\v 17 When Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, "There is a noise of war in the camp."
\v 18 But Moses said, 
\q "It is not the voice of the victor,
\q and not the voice of the defeated,
\q but the sound of singing that I hear."

\s5
\v 19 When Moses approached the camp, he saw the calf and the dancing. He became very angry. He threw the tablets out of his hands and broke them at the bottom of the mountain.
\v 20 He took the calf that the people had made, burned it with fire, ground it to powder, and poured it in the water. Then he made the people of Israel drink it.

\s5
\p
\v 21 Then Moses said to Aaron, "What did this people do to you, that you have brought such a great sin upon them?"
\v 22 Aaron said, "Do not let your anger burn hot, my lord. You know these people, how they are set on evil.
\v 23 They said to me, 'Make us gods who will go before us. As for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.'
\v 24 So I said to them, "Whoever has any gold, let him take it off. They gave me the gold and I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf."

\s5
\p
\v 25 Moses saw that the people were running wild, for Aaron had let them get out of control to the secret delight of their enemies.
\v 26 Then Moses stood at the gate of the camp, and said, "Whoever is on Yahweh's side, come to me." All the Levites gathered themselves around him.
\v 27 He said to them, "Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, 'Let each man fasten his sword on his side and go to and fro from gate to gate throughout the camp, and kill every man his brother, his companion, and his
neighbor.'"

\s5
\v 28 The Levites did what Moses ordered. That day about three thousand men out of the people died.
\v 29 Moses said to the Levites, "Today you have been ordained to the service of Yahweh, for each of you acted against his brother, so Yahweh has given you a blessing today."

\s5
\p
\v 30 The next day Moses said to the people, "You have committed  a very great sin. Now I will go up to Yahweh. Perhaps I can make atonement for your sin."
\v 31 Moses returned to Yahweh and said, "Oh, these people have committed a great sin and have made themselves gods of gold.
\v 32 But now, if you will, forgive their sin; but if not, blot me out of your book that you have written."

\s5
\v 33 Yahweh said to Moses, "Whoever has sinned against me, that person I will blot out of my book.
\v 34 So now go, lead the people to the place of which I have spoken to you. See, my angel will go before you. But in the day that I punish, I will punish them for their sin."
\v 35 Then Yahweh sent a plague on the people because they made the calf, the one Aaron made.





\s5
\c 33
\p
\v 1 Yahweh spoke to Moses, "Go up from here, you and the people whom you have brought up out of the land of Egypt, to the land of which I promised by oath to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, 'To your descendants I will give it.'
\v 2 I will send an angel before you, and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite.
\v 3 Go up to the land flowing with milk and honey, but I will not go up among you, for you are a stiff-necked people, and I might destroy you on the way."

\s5
\v 4 When the people heard these troubling words, they mourned, and no one put on any ornaments.
\v 5 Yahweh said to Moses, "Say to the Israelites, 'You are a stiff-necked people. If I went up among you for even one moment, I would destroy you. Therefore now, take off your ornaments so that I may know what to do with you.'"
\v 6 So the Israelites stripped themselves of their ornaments from Mount Horeb onward.

\s5
\p
\v 7 Moses took the tent and pitched it outside the camp, some distance from the camp. He called it the tent of meeting. Everyone that asked anything of Yahweh went out to the tent of meeting, which was outside the camp.
\v 8 When Moses went out to the tent, all the people arose, stood at their tent doors, and looked at Moses until he had gone into the tent.
\v 9 When Moses entered the tent, the pillar of cloud descended and stood at the door of the tent, and Yahweh spoke with Moses.

\s5
\v 10 When all the people saw the pillar of cloud stand at the door of the tent, they arose and worshiped, every man at his own tent door.
\v 11 Yahweh spoke to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend. Then Moses would return to the camp, but his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, stayed in the tent.

\s5
\p
\v 12 Moses said to Yahweh, "See, you have been saying to me, 'Bring up this people,' but you have not let me know whom you will send with me. You have said, 'I know you by name, and you have also found favor in my sight.'
\v 13 Now if I have found favor in your sight, show me your ways so that I may know you and so that I may continue to find favor in your sight. Remember that this nation is your people."

\s5
\v 14 Yahweh answered, "My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest."
\v 15 Moses said to him, "If your presence does not go with us, do not carry us up from here.
\v 16 For how will it be known that I have found favor in your sight, I and your people? Will it not only be if you go with us so that we are different, I and your people, from all the other peoples that are on the face of the earth?"

\s5
\p
\v 17 Yahweh said to Moses, "I will also do this thing that you have requested, for you have found favor in my sight, and I know you by name."
\v 18 Moses said, "Please show me your glory."

\s5
\v 19 Yahweh said, "I will make all my goodness pass before you, and I will proclaim the name of Yahweh before you. I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and I will show mercy on whom I will show mercy."
\v 20 But he said, "You cannot see my face, for no one can see me and live."

\s5
\v 21 Yahweh said, "Here, there is a place by me, and you will stand on this rock.
\v 22 While my glory passes by, I will put you in a cleft of the rock and will cover you with my hand until I have passed by.
\v 23 Then I will take away my hand, and you will see my back, but my face will not be seen."





\s5
\c 34
\p
\v 1 Yahweh said to Moses, "Cut two tablets of stone like the first tablets. I will write on these tablets the words that were on the first tablets, the ones that you broke.
\v 2 Be ready by morning and come up to Mount Sinai, and present yourself there to me on the top of the mountain.

\s5
\v 3 No one is to come up with you. Do not let anyone be seen anywhere on  the mountain. No flocks or herds are even to graze in front of the mountain."
\v 4 So Moses cut two tablets of stone like the first ones, and he arose early in the morning and went up Mount Sinai, as Yahweh had commanded him. Moses carried the tablets of stone in his hand.

\s5
\v 5 Yahweh  descended in the cloud and stood with Moses there, and he pronounced the name of Yahweh.
\v 6 Yahweh passed by before him and proclaimed, "Yahweh, Yahweh, God ismerciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in covenant faithfulness and trustworthiness,
\v 7 keeping covenant faithfulness for thousands of generations, forgiving iniquities, transgressions, and sins. But he will by no means clear the guilty. He will bring the punishment for the fathers' sin upon their children and upon their children’s children, as far as the third and fourth generations."

\s5
\v 8 Moses quickly bowed his head to the ground and worshiped.
\v 9 Then he said, "If now I have found favor in your sight, my Lord, please go among us, for this people is stubborn. Pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for your inheritance."

\s5
\p
\v 10 Yahweh said, "See, I am about to make a covenant. Before all your people, I will do marvels such as have not been done in all the earth nor in any nation. All the people among you will see the work of Yahweh, for it is a fearful thing that I am doing with you.
\v 11 Obey what I command you today. I am about to drive out before you the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite.

\s5
\v 12 Be careful not to make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land where you are going so that they will not be a snare among you.
\v 13 Instead, you will break down their altars, smash their sacred stone pillars, and cut down their Asherah poles.
\v 14 For you will worship no other god, for Yahweh, whose name is 'Jealous,' is a jealous God.

\s5
\v 15 Do not make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land when they commit adultery, going after their gods and sacrificing to them, or when someone invites you to eat some of his sacrifice.
\v 16 If so, you will even take some of their daughters for your sons, and their daughters will commit adultery and go after their own gods, and they will make your sons commit adultery and go after their gods.
\v 17 You will make no molten gods.

\s5
\p
\v 18 You will keep the Festival of Unleavened Bread. As I commanded you, for seven days you will eat bread without yeast at the appointed time in the month of Abib, for in the month of Abib you came out from Egypt.

\s5
\v 19 All the firstborn are mine, even every firstborn of your cattle that is male, both of  ox and sheep.
\v 20 The firstborn of a donkey you will redeem with a lamb, but if you do not redeem it, then you will break its neck. All the firstborn of your sons you will redeem. No one will appear before me empty handed.

\s5
\p
\v 21 Six days you will work, but on the seventh day you will rest; even at plowing time and in harvest, you will rest.
\v 22 You will observe the Festival of Weeks with the first yield of the wheat harvest, and you will observe the Festival of Ingathering at the year’s end.

\s5
\v 23 Three times in the year all your men will appear before Yahweh, the God of Israel.
\v 24 For I will drive out nations before you and enlarge your borders. No one will desire to take your land when you go up to appear before Yahweh, your God, three times every year.

\s5
\p
\v 25 You must not offer the blood of my sacrifice with any yeast, nor will the sacrifice of the Festival of the Passover be left to the morning.
\v 26 The best of the first fruits from your land you will bring to the house of Yahweh,  your God. You will not boil a kid in its mother’s milk."

\s5
\v 27 Yahweh said to Moses, "Write down these words, for I pledge myself to these words I have said, and have made a covenant with you and with Israel."
\v 28 Moses was there with Yahweh for forty days and forty nights; he did not eat bread nor drink water. He wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.

\s5
\p
\v 29 When Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the two tablets of the testimony in his hand, he did not know that the skin of his face had become radiant while he spoke with God.
\v 30 When Aaron and the  Israelites saw Moses, the skin of his face shone, and they were afraid to come near him.
\v 31 But Moses called to them, and Aaron and all the leaders of the community came back to him. Then Moses spoke to them.

\s5
\v 32 After this, all the people of Israel came near to him, and he told them all the commands that Yahweh had  given him on Mount Sinai.
\v 33 When Moses had finished speaking with them, he put a veil over his face.

\s5
\v 34 Whenever Moses went before Yahweh to speak with him, he would remove the veil until he came away. Then he would come out and tell the Israelites what he had been commanded.
\v 35 The Israelites saw the face of Moses; they saw his face shining. Then Moses would put the veil upon his face again until he went back in to speak with Yahweh.





\s5
\c 35
\p
\v 1 Moses assembled all the community of the Israelites and said to them, "These are the things that Yahweh has commandedyou to do.
\v 2 On six days work may be done, but the seventh day shall be to you a holy day, a Sabbath of complete rest to Yahweh. Anyone who does any work on it will be put to death.
\v 3 You must not kindle a fire in any of your homes on the Sabbath day."

\s5
\p
\v 4 Moses spoke to all the community of the Israelites, saying, "This is the thing that Yahweh commanded.
\v 5 Take an offering for Yahweh, everyone who is of a willing heart; bring an offering to Yahweh—gold, silver, and bronze;
\v 6  blue, purple, and scarlet wool and fine linen; goats’ hair;
\v 7  rams’ skins dyed red and sea cow hides; acacia wood;
\v 8 oil for the light; spices for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense;
\v 9  and onyx stones and other precious stones to be set for the ephod and for the breastpiece.

\s5
\p
\v 10 Every skilled man among you is to come and make all that Yahweh has commanded—
\v 11 the tabernacle with its tent, its covering, its clasps, its boards, its bars, its posts, and its bases;
\v 12 the ark with its poles, the atonement lid and the veil that conceals it;

\s5
\v 13 the table with its poles, all its utensils; and the bread of the presence;
\v 14 the lampstand for the lights, with its utensils, its lamps, and the oil for the lights;
\v 15 the altar of incense with its poles, the anointing oil and the fragrant incense; the hanging for the door at the entrance to the tabernacle;
\v 16 the altar of burnt offering with its grate of bronze and its poles and its utensils; the large basin with its base;

\s5
\v 17 the hangings of the courtyard with its posts and bases and the curtain for the gate of the court;
\v 18 the tent pegs of the tabernacle and of the court with their cords; and
\v 19 the fine garments for serving in the holy place, the holy garments for Aaron the priest and those for his sons so that they may serve as priests."

\s5
\p
\v 20 Then all the tribes of Israel left and went away from the presence of Moses.
\v 21 Everyone whose heart stirred him up and everyone whom his spirit made willing came and brought an offering for Yahweh for the construction of the tabernacle, for all the items for service in it, and for the holy garments.
\v 22 They came, both men and women, all who had a willing heart. They brought brooches, earrings, rings, and ornaments, all kinds of gold  jewelry. They all presented an offering of gold to Yahweh.

\s5
\v 23 Everyone who had blue, purple, or scarlet wool,  fine linen, goats’ hair, rams’ skins dyed red, or sea cows skins brought them.
\v 24 Everyone making  an offering of silver and brass brought it as an offering to Yahweh, and everyone who had acacia wood for any work of the service brought it.

\s5
\v 25 Every woman who was skilled spun with her hands and brought what she  had spun—blue,  purple, or scarlet wool, or fine linen.
\v 26 All the women whose hearts stirred them up and who had skill spun goats' hair.

\s5
\v 27 The leaders brought onyx stones and other gems to be set for the ephod and the breastpiece;
\v 28 they brought spices and oil for the light, for the anointing oil, and for the fragrant incense.
\v 29 The Israelites brought a free will offering to Yahweh; every man and woman whose heart made them willing brought materials for all the work that Yahweh had commanded through Moses to be made.

\s5
\p
\v 30 Moses said to the Israelites, "See, Yahweh has chosen Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah.
\v 31 He has filled Bezalel with the spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, in knowledge, and in all manner of craftsmanship
\v 32  to design artistic works, to work in gold and in silver and in bronze,
\v 33 to cut stones for setting, to carve wood, and to do all kinds of skillful craftsmanship.

\s5
\v 34 He has put it in his heart to teach, both he and Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan.
\v 35 He has filled them with skill to do all kinds of work, to work as craftsmen, as engravers, as embroiderers in blue, purple, and scarlet wool and fine linen, and as weavers. They are craftsmen in all sorts of work, and they are artistic designers.





\s5
\c 36
\p
\v 1 So Bezalel and Oholiab will work, as well as every wise-hearted person in whom Yahweh has put skill and the understanding to know how to build the sanctuary, following the instructions Yahweh has commanded you to do."

\s5
\p
\v 2 Moses summoned Bezalel and Oholiab, and every skillful man, in whose heart Yahweh had given skill, and whose heart stirred within him to come and do the work.
\v 3 They received from Moses all the offerings that the Israelites had brought for constructing the sanctuary. The people were still bringing free-will offerings every morning to Moses.
\v 4 So all the skilled people who were doing the work on the sanctuary came from the work that they had been doing.

\s5
\v 5 They told Moses, "The people are bringing much more than enough for doing the work that Yahweh has commanded us to do."
\v 6 So Moses instructed that throughout the camp people no longer bring offerings for the construction of the sanctuary. Then the people stopped bringing these gifts.
\v 7 They had more than enough materials for all the work.

\s5
\p
\v 8 So all the craftsmen among them made the tabernacle with ten curtains, made with fine linen and with blue, purple, and scarlet wool with the designs of cherubim, the work of Bezalel, the artistic designer.
\v 9 The length of each curtain was twenty-eight cubits, the width four cubits, and all the curtains had the same size.
\v 10 Bezalel joined five curtains to each other, and the other five curtains he also joined to each other.

\s5
\v 11 He made loops of blue along the edge of the end curtain of the first set, and he did the same along the edge of the end curtain in the second set.
\v 12 He made fifty loops on the first curtain in the first set and fifty loops on the edge of the end curtain in the second set, with the loops opposite one to another.
\v 13 He made fifty gold clasps and joined the curtains together with the clasps so that the tabernacle became united.

\s5
\p
\v 14 Bezalel made curtains of goats’ hair for a tent-like covering over the tabernacle; he made eleven of these curtains.
\v 15 The length of each curtain was thirty cubits, and the width of each curtain was four cubits. Each of the eleven curtains was the same size.
\v 16 He joined five curtains to each other and the other six curtains to each other.
\v 17 He made fifty loops on the edge of the end curtain of the first set, and fifty loops along the edge of the end curtain that joined the second set.

\s5
\v 18 Bezalel made fifty bronze clasps to join the tent together so that it might be united.
\v 19 He made for the tabernacle a covering of rams’ skins dyed red, and above that, another covering of fine leather.

\s5
\p
\v 20 Bezalel made the frames for the tabernacle, uprights frames of acacia wood.
\v 21 The length of each frame was ten cubits and the width of each frame was one and a half cubits.
\v 22 There were two projections from each frame parallel with each other. He made all the tabernacle's frames in this way.
\v 23 Thus he made the frames for the tabernacle. He made twenty frames for the south side

\s5
\v 24 and forty silver bases to go under the twenty frames, two bases under each frame, one base for each projection.
\v 25 For the second side of the tabernacle, on the north side, he made twenty frames
\v 26 and their forty bases of silver; two bases under each frame.

\s5
\v 27 For the back of the tabernacle, to the west, Bezalel made six frames.
\v 28 He made two frames for the back corners of the tabernacle.

\s5
\v 29 At the corners the frames were doubled from the bottom to the top, ending in one ring. Both corners were constructed the same way.
\v 30 There were eight frames, together with their silver bases, sixteen bases in all, two bases under each frame.

\s5
\p
\v 31 Bezalel  made bars of acacia wood—five for the frames on one side of the tabernacle,
\v 32 five bars for the frames on the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the frames of the tabernacle on the back side toward the west. 
\v 33 He made the middle bar to reach from end to end in the center of the frames.
\v 34 He overlaid the frames with gold and made their golden rings for places for the bars to rest. He then overlaid the bars with gold.

\s5
\p
\v 35 Bezalel made the curtain of blue, purple, and scarlet wool, and of fine linen, with designs of cherubim, the work of an artistic designer.
\v 36 He made for the curtain four posts of acacia wood, and overlaid them with gold. He also made gold hooks for the posts, and he cast for them four bases made of silver.

\s5
\v 37 He made a hanging for the entrance of the tent. It was made of blue, purple, and scarlet wool, and of fine linen, the work of the embroiderer.
\v 38 He also made the hanging's five posts with their hooks. He overlaid their tops and their rods with gold. Their five bases were made of bronze.





\s5
\c 37
\p
\v 1 Bezalel made the ark of the testimony with acacia wood. Its length was two cubits and a half, its width was one cubit and a half, and its height was one cubit and a half.
\v 2 He overlaid it with pure gold inside and out and made a surrounding border of gold.
\v 3 He cast four rings of gold for its four supports, two rings on one side of it, and two rings on the other side.

\s5
\v 4 He made poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold.
\v 5 He put the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark, to carry the ark.
\v 6 He made an atonement lid of pure gold; its length was two cubits and a half, and its width was one cubit and a half.

\s5
\v 7 Bezalel made two cherubim of hammered gold for the two ends of the atonement lid.
\v 8 One cherub was at one end, and other cherub at the other end of the atonement lid. They were of one piece with the atonement lid.
\v 9 The cherubim's wings were spread upward and overshadowed the atonement lid. The cherubim faced each another, looking  toward the center of the atonement lid.

\s5
\p
\v 10 Bezalel made the table of acacia wood: its length was two cubits, its width was one cubit, and its height was one cubit and a half.
\v 11 He overlaid it with pure gold and made a surrounding border of pure gold for it.
\v 12 He made a surrounding frame for it one handbreath wide, with a surrounding border of gold for the frame. 
\v 13 He cast for it four rings of gold and attached the rings to the four corners where the four feet were.

\s5
\v 14 The rings were close to the frame to provide places for the poles, to carry the table.
\v 15 He made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold, to carry the table.
\v 16 He made of pure gold the vessels that would be on the table—the dishes, the cups, the bowls, and the pitchers used to pour out the offering.

\s5
\p
\v 17 He made the lampstand of pure hammered gold. He made the lampstand, its base, its shaft, its cups, its buds, and its flowers of one piece with it.
\v 18 Six branches extended from its sides; three branches of the lampstand extended from one side, and three branches of the lampstand extended from the other side.
\v 19 Three cups made like almond blossoms were on one branch, each with a bud and a flower, and three cups made like almond-blossoms were on the next branch, each with a bud and a flower; it was the same for all six branches extending from the lampstand.

\s5
\v 20 On the lampstand were four cups made like almond blossoms, with buds and flowers,
\v 21 There was a bud under the first pair of branches extending from it, a bud under its next pair of branches, and a bud under its third pair of branches, for all six branches extending from the lampstand.
\v 22 The buds and branches were all of one piece, all of it was one hammered piece of  pure gold.

\s5
\v 23 Bezalel made the lampstand's seven lamps, its trimmers, and its trays  of pure gold.
\v 24 He made the lampstand and its accessories with seventy five pounds of pure gold.

\s5
\p
\v 25 Bezalel made the altar of incense with acacia wood. The length was one cubit and the width one cubit—a square---and the height was two cubits. The horns were one piece with it.
\v 26 He overlaid it with pure gold---the top, the sides, and its horns. He also made a surrounding border for it with pure gold.

\s5
\v 27 He made for it two golden rings under its border, on two opposite sides, as places for the poles, to carry it.
\v 28 He made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold.
\v 29 He made the holy anointing oil and the pure fragrant incense, the work of a perfumer.





\s5
\c 38
\p
\v 1 Bezalel made the altar of burnt offering of acacia wood. It was five cubits long and five cubits wide—a square---and three cubits  high.
\v 2 He made the horns for it at the four corners. The horns were of one piece with the table, and he overlaid it all with bronze.
\v 3 He made all the utensils of the altar—the pots, the shovels, the basins, the meat forks, and the firepans. He made all the utensils with bronze.

\s5
\v 4 He made for the altar a grate of bronze for under the ledge, halfway up from the bottom.
\v 5 He cast four rings for the four ends of the bronze grate, as holders for the poles.

\s5
\v 6 Bezalel made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with bronze.
\v 7 He put the poles through the rings on the sides of the altar, to carry it. He made the altar with planks so that it was hollow.

\s5
\p
\v 8 Bezalel made the bronze basin and its base of bronze out of the mirrors of the women who served at the entrance of the tent of meeting.

\s5
\p
\v 9 Bezalel made the courtyard. The hangings on the south side of the courtyard were of fine linen, one hundred cubits long, 
\v 10 with twenty posts and twenty bronze bases. The hooks and rods of the posts were of silver.

\s5
\v 11 The hangings on the north side were of fine linen, one hundred cubits long, with twenty posts and twenty bronze bases. The hooks and rods of the posts were of silver.
\v 12 The hangings of the west side were fifty cubits long, with ten posts and bases. The hooks and rods of the posts were silver.

\s5
\v 13 The hangings for the east side, toward the sunrise, were fifty cubits long.
\v 14 The hangings for one side of the entrance were fifteen cubits long, with three posts and three bases.
\v 15 On the other side of the entrance of the court were hangings fifteen cubits long, with three posts and three bases. 
\v 16 All the hangings around the courtyard were of fine linen.

\s5
\v 17 The bases of the posts were of bronze. The hooks and rods of the posts were of silver, and the covering for the tops of the posts was of silver. All the posts of the court were covered with silver.
\v 18 The curtain for the entrance of the court was the work of the embroiderer, of blue, and purple, and scarlet wool and of fine linen. It was twenty cubits long and five cubits high.
\v 19 It had four bases of bronze and hooks of silver. The covering for their tops and its rods were of silver.
\v 20 All the tent pegs of the tabernacle and of the courtyard were of bronze.

\s5
\p
\v 21 This is the inventory for the tabernacle, the tabernacle of the testimony, as it was counted by following the commandment of Moses. It was the work of the Levites under the direction of Ithamar, the son of Aaron the priest.
\v 22 Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah made all that Yahweh had commanded Moses.
\v 23 Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan worked with Bezalel as an engraver, as a skillful workman, and as an embroiderer in blue, in purple, and in scarlet wool, and in fine linen.

\s5
\p
\v 24 All the gold that was used for the project, in all the work of the sanctuary, the gold of the presentation offering, was 29 talents and 730 shekels, measured by the standard of the sanctuary shekel.
\v 25 The silver weighed from the community was 100 talents and 1,775 shekels, according to the sanctuary shekel, 
\v 26 or one beka per man, which is half a shekel, measured by the weight of the sanctuary shekel, for each person who was counted in the census, those twenty years old and older—603,550 men in all.

\s5
\v 27 One hundred talents of silver were cast for the bases of the sanctuary and the bases of the curtain; one hundred bases, one talent for each base.
\v 28 With the remaining 1,775 shekels of silver, Bezalel made the hooks for the posts, covered the tops of the posts, and made the rods for them.
\v 29 The bronze from the offering was 70 talents and 2,400 shekels.

\s5
\v 30 With this he made the bases for the entrance of the tent of meeting, the bronze altar, its bronze grate, and all the utensils for the altar,
\v 31 the bases for the courtyard, the bases for the courtyard's entrance, all the tent pegs of the tabernacle, and all the pegs of the courtyard.





\s5
\c 39
\p
\v 1 With the blue, purple, and scarlet wool, they made finely woven garments for service in the holy place; they made the holy garments for Aaron, as Yahweh had commanded Moses.

\s5
\p
\v 2 Bezalel made the ephod of gold and of blue, purple, and scarlet wool and of fine linen.
\v 3 They hammered gold sheets and cut them into wires, to work them into the blue, purple, and scarlet wool, and into the fine linen, the work of the skillful workman.

\s5
\v 4 They made  shoulder pieces for the ephod, attached at its two upper edges.
\v 5 The skillfully woven waistband that was on the ephod was of the same material, of gold, of blue, purple, and scarlet wool, and of fine linen, as Yahweh had commanded Moses.

\s5
\p
\v 6 They crafted the onyx stones, enclosed in settings of gold, set with the engravings of a signet, and engraved with the names of the sons of Israel.
\v 7 He put them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod, to be stones of remembrance for the people of Israel, as Yahweh had commanded Moses.

\s5
\p
\v 8 He made the breastpiece, the work of the skillful workman, like the work of the ephod; of gold, of blue, purple, and scarlet wool, and of fine linen.
\v 9 It was square. They made the breastpiece double; its length was one span and its width was one span.

\s5
\v 10 They set in it four rows of stones. The first row was of a ruby, a topaz, and an emerald. 
\v 11 The second row was of a turquoise, a sapphire, and a diamond.
\v 12 The third row was of a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst.
\v 13 The fourth row was of a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper. The stones were placed in settings of gold.

\s5
\v 14 The stones were arranged by the names of the sons of Israel, twelve, each in order by name; like the engravings of a signet, every one with its name of one of the twelve tribes.
\v 15 On the breastpiece they made chains like cords, braided work of pure gold.
\v 16 They made two settings of gold and two gold rings, and put the two rings on the two corners of the breastpiece.

\s5
\v 17 They put the two braided chains of gold in the two rings at the corners of the breastpiece.
\v 18 The other two ends of the braided chains they put on the two settings; they put them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod in front.

\s5
\v 19 They made two rings of gold and put them upon the two other corners of the breastpiece, on the edge next to the inner border.
\v 20 They made two other rings of gold and put them on the bottom of the two shoulder pieces of the ephod, on its front close to its seam, above the skillfully woven waistband of the ephod.

\s5
\v 21 They tied the breastpiece by its rings to the rings of the ephod with a blue cord so that it might be attached above the skillfully woven band of the ephod so that the breastpiece was permanently attached to the ephod. This was as Yahweh had commanded Moses.

\s5
\p
\v 22 Bezalel made the robe of the ephod—the work of a weaver and made entirely of blue yarn.
\v 23 The opening of the robe in its center had a woven edge around it so that it would not tear.
\v 24 On the edge of the robe, they made pomegranates of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn and of fine linen.

\s5
\v 25 They made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates on the edge the robe, between the pomegranates---
\v 26 a bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate---upon the edge of the robe to serve in; this was as Yahweh had commanded Moses.

\s5
\p
\v 27 They made the coats of finely woven linen for Aaron and for his sons,
\v 28 and they made the turban of fine linen, the ornate head bands of fine linen, the linen undergarments of fine linen,
\v 29 and the sash of fine linen, and blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, the work of the embroiderer; this was as Yahweh had commanded Moses.

\s5
\p
\v 30 They made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold; they wrote upon it, like the engraving on a signet, HOLY TO YAHWEH.
\v 31 They tied a blue cord to it to fasten it to the turban above; as Yahweh had commanded Moses.

\s5
\p
\v 32 So the work of the tabernacle, the tent of meeting, was finished; the people of Israel did following all the instructions  that Yahweh had commanded Moses.
\v 33 They brought the tabernacle to Moses—the tent and all its furniture, its clasps, its boards, its bars, its posts, and its bases;
\v 34 the covering of rams’ skins dyed red, the covering of fine leather, and the curtain for the entrance;
\v 35 the ark of the testimony, its poles, and the atonement lid;

\s5
\v 36 the table, all its utensils, and the bread of the presence;
\v 37 the lampstand of pure gold, its lamps and all its utensils, and the oil for the lights;
\v 38 the golden altar, the anointing oil, the fragrant incense, and the curtain for the entrance of the tent;
\v 39 the bronze altar and its grate of bronze, its poles and all its utensils; the bronze basin and its base;

\s5
\v 40 the hanging for the courtyard, its posts and its bases, and the curtain for the entrance of the courtyard, its cords and its pegs; and all the equipment of the service of the tabernacle, the tent of meeting;
\v 41 and the finely woven garments for service in the holy place—the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments for his sons, for them to serve as priests. 

\s5
\v 42 Thus the people of Israel did all the work as Yahweh had commanded Moses.
\v 43 Moses examined all the work, and, behold, they had done it; as Yahweh had commanded, thus they did it. Then Moses blessed them.





\s5
\c 40
\p
\v 1 Then Yahweh spoke to Moses,
\v 2 "On the first day of the first month you will set up the tabernacle, the tent of meeting.

\s5
\v 3 You will place the ark of the testimony in it, and you will shield the ark with the curtain.
\v 4 You will bring in the table and set in order the things that belong on it; then you will bring in the lampstand and set up the lamps.

\s5
\v 5 You will put the golden altar for incense before the ark of the testimony, you will put the curtain at the entrance to the tabernacle.
\v 6 You will put the altar of burnt offering in front of the entranc  to the tabernacle, the tent of meeting.
\v 7 You will put the large basin between the tent of meeting and the altar, and you will put water in it.

\s5
\v 8 You will set up the courtyard around it, and you will hang up the curtain at the entrance of the courtyard.
\v 9 You will take the anointing oil and anoint the tabernacle, and all that is in it. You will consecrate it and all its furnishings; then it will be holy.
\v 10 You will anoint the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils; you will sanctify the altar, and the altar will be most holy.
\v 11 You will anoint the bronze basin and its base, and sanctify it.

\s5
\v 12 You are to bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance of the tent of meeting, and you will wash them with water.
\v 13 You are to clothe Aaron with the holy garments and anoint him and consecrate him so that he may serve as my priest.

\s5
\v 14 You are to bring his sons and clothe them with coats.
\v 15 You will anoint them as you anointed their father so that they may serve me as priests. Their anointing will make them an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations."
\v 16 This is what Moses did; he followed all that Yahweh had commanded him; and so he did.

\s5
\p
\v 17 So the tabernacle was set up on the first day of the first month in the second year.
\v 18  Moses set up the tabernacle, put its bases in place, set up its frames, attached it bars, and set up its posts.
\v 19 He spread the tent over the tabernacle and put the covering of the tent over it, as Yahweh had commanded him.
\v 20 He took the testimony and put it into the ark, set the poles on the ark, and put the atonement lid on the ark.

\s5
\v 21 He brought the ark into the tabernacle and set up the curtain, shielding the ark of the testimony, as Yahweh had commanded him.
\v 22 He put the table in the tent of meeting, on the north side of the tabernacle, outside the curtain.
\v 23 He set the bread in order upon it before Yahweh, as Yahweh had commanded him.

\s5
\v 24 He put the lampstand in the tent of meeting, across from the table, on the south side of the tabernacle.
\v 25 He lit the lamps before Yahweh, as Yahweh had commanded him.

\s5
\v 26 He put the golden altar in the tent of meeting before the curtain.
\v 27 He burned fragrant incense on it, as Yahweh had commanded him.

\s5
\v 28 He hung the curtain at the entrance to the tabernacle.
\v 29 He put the altar for the burnt offering at the entrance of the tabernacle, the tent of meeting, and offered on it the burnt offering and the grain offering, as Yahweh had commanded him.
\v 30 He set the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar, and he put water in it for washing.

\s5
\v 31 Moses, Aaron, and his sons washed their hands and their feet from it
\v 32 when they went into the tent of meeting and when they approached the altar. They washed, as Yahweh had commanded Moses.
\v 33 Moses set up the courtyard around the tabernacle and the altar, and he set up the curtain of the entrance of the courtyard. Thus Moses finished the work.

\s5
\p
\v 34 Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of Yahweh filled the tabernacle.
\v 35 Moses was not able to enter into the tent of meeting because the cloud had settled on it, and the glory of Yahweh filled the tabernacle.

\s5
\v 36 Whenever the cloud lifted up from over the tabernacle, the people of Israel would set out on their journey.
\v 37 But if the cloud was not lifted up, then they would not journey until the day that it was lifted up.
\v 38 For the cloud of Yahweh was on the tabernacle by day, and fire was upon it by night, in plain view of all the people of Israel throughout all their journeys.
